<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Footnote anchors are denoted by <span class="fnanchor">[number]</span>, and the footnotes have been
placed at the end of each chapter. Four digit items such as [1466] are
not footnote anchors but refer to a year.</p>

<p>Macrons over e and u are displayed correctly as ē and ū. Some latin
abbreviations are shown in the original text with an overline, for
example Hiberniæ when abbreviated is displayed in the etext as
H<span class="over">ibni</span>æ, similarly to the original text.</p>

<p>Basic fractions are displayed as ½ ¼ ¾; there are no other fractions
in this book.</p>

<p>Date ranges are displayed using &ndash; for example 1621&ndash;8, the same as the
original text.</p>

<p>Split-year dates are displayed similarly to the original text, for example
160<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">0</span>
  <span class="blka over">1</span>
</span>.
The dual dates indicate the Julian (1600) and the
Gregorian (1601) year designation for dates between January 1st and
March 25th. Prior to 1752 dates in documents in British dominions
used the Julian calendar, in which the new year did not begin until
March 25th.</p>

<p class="handonly">On a handheld device the tables on <a href="#Page_288">pages 288</a> and 289
are best displayed using a small font to avoid truncation of the columns.</p>

<p>Some other minor changes to the text are noted at the <a href="#TN">end of the book.</a></p>

<p>Through illness, Professor E. Dowden was unable to take any active part in the
preparation of this volume, the publication of which was undertaken by the firm of Messrs.
Marcus Ward &amp; Co., Limited, of Belfast. The time at the disposal of the writers of the
following chapters was extremely short, and they tender an apology for the want of
completeness, which, on an exact scrutiny of their work, will, they fear, be only too
conspicuous; but it is hoped that the volume may be acceptable as a sketch towards a
History of the College.</p>

<p>The name of the writer of each chapter is given in the Table of Contents, and
each author is to be regarded as accountable only for his own share of the work. The
Committee’s grateful thanks are due to Mr. Louis Fagan, of the Department of Prints and
Drawings, British Museum, for the help he has given them in having reproductions made
from rare engravings of some of the distinguished Graduates of the University.</p>

<div><img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_013b.jpg" width="100" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">The origin of the University of Dublin is not shrouded in darkness,
as are the origins of the Universities of Bologna and Oxford. The details
of the foundation are well known, in the clear light of Elizabethan times;
the names of the promoters and benefactors are on record; and yet when
we come to examine the dates current in the histories of the University and the
relative merits of the promoters, there arise many perplexities. The grant of the
Charter is in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and we record every day in the
College our gratitude for her benefaction; but it is no secret that she was urged
to this step by a series of advisers, of whom the most important and persuasive
remained in the background.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The project of founding a University in Ireland had long been contemplated, and the
current histories record various attempts, as old as 1311, to accomplish this end&mdash;attempts which
all failed promptly, and produced no effect upon the country, unless it were to afford to the
Roman Catholic prelates, who petitioned James II. to hand over Trinity College to their control,
some colour for their astonishing preamble.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is not the province of these chapters to narrate or
discuss these earlier schemes. One feature they certainly possessed&mdash;the very feature denied them
in the petition just named. Most of them were essentially ecclesiastical, and closely attached to
the Cathedral corporations. There seems never to have been a secular teacher appointed
in any of them&mdash;not to speak of mere frameworks, like that of the University of Drogheda.
Another feature also they all present: they are without any reasonable endowment, the
only serious offer being that of Sir John Perrott in 1585, who proposed the still current
method of exhibiting English benevolence towards Ireland by robbing one Irish body
to endow another. In this case, S. Patrick’s Cathedral, “because it was held in
superstitious reverence by the people,” was to be plundered of its revenues to set up
two Colleges&mdash;one in Armagh and one in Limerick. This plan was thwarted, not only
by the downfall of its originator (Perrott), but by the active opposition of an eminent
Churchman&mdash;Adam Loftus, the Archbishop of Dublin. The violent mutual hostility of these
two men may have stimulated each to promote a public object disadvantageous to the
other. Perrott urged the disendowment of S. Patrick’s because he knew that the Archbishop
had retained a large pecuniary interest in it. Perhaps Loftus promoted a rival plan
because he feared some future revival of Perrott’s scheme. Both attest their bitter feelings:
for in his defence upon his trial Perrott calls the Archbishop his deadly enemy; and Loftus, in
the Latin speech made in Trinity College when he resigned the Provostship, takes special credit
for having resisted the overbearing fury of Perrott, and having gained for Leinster the College
which the other sought to establish either in Armagh or Limerick, exposed to the dangers of
rebellion and devastation.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But before this audience, who knew the circumstances, he does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
make any claim to have been the original promoter of the foundation. Even in his defence of
S. Patrick’s, he had a supporter perhaps more persuasive, because he was more respected. It is
mentioned in praise of Henry Ussher, “he so lucidly and with such strength of arguments
defended the rights of S. Patrick’s Church, which Perrott meant to turn into a College, that he
averted that dire omen.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Nevertheless, the Archbishop is generally credited with being the
real founder of Trinity College, and indeed his speeches to the citizens of Dublin, of which
two are still extant, might lead to that conclusion. But other and more potent influences
were at work.</p>

<p>Some years before, Case, in the preface to his <cite>Speculum Moralium Quæstionum</cite> (1585),
had addressed the Chancellors of Cambridge and Oxford conjointly on the crying want
of a proper University, to subdue the turbulence and barbarism of the Irish. This appeal
was not original, or isolated, or out of sympathy with the age. Such laymen as Spencer,
and as Bryskett, Spencer’s host near Dublin, must have long urged similar arguments.
In 1547, Archbishop George Browne had forwarded to Sir William Cecil a scheme for
establishing a College with the revenues of the then recently suppressed S. Patrick’s.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Another scheme is extant, endorsed by Cecil, dated October, 1563, with salaries named, but not
the source of the endowment. In 1571, John Ussher, in applying for the rights of staple at
the port of Dublin, says in his petition that he intends to leave his fortune to found a
College in Dublin. In 1584, the Rev. R. Draper petitions Burghley to have the University
founded at Trim, in the centre of the Pale, as this site possessed a waterway to Drogheda,
and was furnished with great ancient buildings, then deserted, and falling into decay.</p>

<p>But in addition to these appeals of sentiment, there were practical men at work.
Two successive Deputies, Sir Henry Sidney and Sir John Perrott, had urged the necessity
of some such foundation (1565, 1585), and the former had even offered pecuniary aid.
The Queen, long urged in this direction, had ultimately been persuaded, as appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
from her Warrant, that the City of Dublin was prepared to grant a site, and help in
building the proposed College; and the City, no doubt, had been equally persuaded that the
Queen would endow the site. The practical workers in this diplomacy have been set down in
history as Cambridge men. This is one of those true statements which disguise the truth.
The real agitators in the matter were Luke Challoner and Henry Ussher. A glance at Mr.
Gilbert’s <cite>Assembly Rolls of the City of Dublin</cite> the reign of Elizabeth will show how both
family names occur perpetually in the Corporation as mayors, aldermen, etc.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The very
site of the future College had been let upon lease to a Challoner and to the uncle of an Ussher.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
These were the influential City families which swayed the Corporation. Henry Ussher,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who
had become Archdeacon of Dublin, went as emissary to Court; Challoner<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> superintended
the gathering of funds and the laying out of the site, which his family had rented
years before. It was therefore by Dublin men&mdash;by citizens whose sons had merely
been educated at Cambridge, and had learned there to appreciate University culture&mdash;that
Trinity College was really founded. They had learned to compare Cambridge and
Oxford, with Dublin, life, and when they came home to their paternal city, they felt the
wide difference.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, in her Warrant, puts the case quite differently. She does not,
indeed, make the smallest mention of Loftus, but of the prayer of the City of Dublin, preferred
by Henry Ussher, thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><em>December 29, 1592.</em></p>

<p class="noindent smcap">Elizabeth, R.</p>

<p>Trustee and right well beloved we greet you well, where[as] by your Lrēs, and the rest of our Councell
joyned with you, directed to our Councell here, wee perceive that the Major and the Cittizens of Dublin
are very well disposed to grant the scite of the Abbey of Allhallows belonging to the said Citty to the yearly
value of Twenty pounds to serve for a Colledge for learning, whereby knowledge and Civility might be
increased by the instruction of our people there, whereof many have usually heretofore used to travaile into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ffrance Italy and Spaine to gett learning in such forreigne universities, whereby they have been infected with
poperie and other ill qualities, and soe became evill subjects, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Usshers and the Challoners had no inclination to go to Spain or France, nor is it
likely that they ever thought they would prevent the Irish Catholic priesthood from favouring
this foreign education. They desired to ennoble their city by giving it a College similar to those
of Oxford and Cambridge, and they succeeded.</p>

<p>The extant speech of Adam Loftus, to which I have already referred, makes no allusion
to these things. His argument is homely enough. Guarding himself from preaching the doctrine
of good works, which would have a Papistical complexion, he urges the Mayor and Corporation
to consider how the trades had suffered by the abolition of the monasteries, under the previous
Sovereign; how the city of Oxford and town of Cambridge have flourished owing to their Colleges;
how the prosperity of Dublin, now depending on the presence of the Lord Deputy and his retinue
and the Inns of Court, will be increased by a College, which would bring strangers, and with them
money, to the citizens. Thus it will be a means of civilising the nation and enriching the city,
and will enable many of their children to work their own advancement, “and in order thereto ye
will be pleased to call a Common Council and deliberate thereon, having first informed the
several Masters of every Company of the pregnant likelihood of advantage,” etc. Again,
“it is my hearty desire that you would express your and the City’s thankfulness to Her
Majesty,” etc.</p>

<p>This harangue, in which “our good Lord the Archbushopp” gives himself the whole credit
of the transaction, is said to have been delivered “soon after the Quarter Sessions of St. John the
Baptist”&mdash;viz., about July, but in what year I cannot discover. Mr. Gilbert says, “<em>after Easter</em>,
in the year 1590.” In Loftus’ Latin speech occurs&mdash;“As soon as I had proposed it to the Mayor
and Sheriffs, without any delay they assembled in full conclave and voted the whole site of the
monastery.” But in the meetings of the Dublin Council there is no allusion whatever to this
speech, no thanks to the Queen, no resolution on the matter whatever, till under the date
“Fourth Friday after December, 1590” (33 Elizabeth), we find the following modest business
entry:&mdash;“Forasmoch as there is in this Assembly by certayne well-disposed persons petition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
preferred,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> declaring many good and effectual persuacions to move our furtherance for setting
upp and erecting a Collage for the bringing upp of yeouth to learning, whereof we, having a
good lyking, do, so farr as in us lyeth, herby agree and order that the scite of Alhallowes
and the parkes thereof shalbe wholly gyven for the erection of a Collage there; and withall
we require that we may have conference with the preferrers of the said peticion to conclude
how the same shalbe fynished.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Queen’s Warrant is signed the 29th December, 1592
(34 Elizabeth).<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is hard to find any logical place for the Archbishop’s speech, either before,
between, or after these dates and documents.</p>

<p>At all events, the Queen gave a Warrant and Charter, some small Crown rents on various
estates in the South and West of Ireland, and presently, upon further petition, a yearly gift of
nearly £400 from the Concordatum Fund, which latter the College enjoyed till the present
century, when it was resumed by the Government. From the Elizabethan Crown rents the
College now derives about £5 per annum. The Charter was surrendered for that of Charles I.</p>

<p>Thus the benevolences of Elizabeth, like the buildings of her foundation, have dwindled
away and disappeared.</p>

<p>The Archbishop’s sounding words have had their weight in benefiting his own memory,
as has been shown, beyond his merits in this matter.</p>

<p>The modest gift of the Corporation of Dublin, consisting of 28 acres of derelict land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
partly invaded by the sea, has become a splendid property, in money value not less than £10,000
a-year, in convenience and in dignity to the College perfectly inestimable.</p>

<p>The necessary sum for repairing the decayed Abbey of All Hallowes, and for what new
buildings the College required, was raised by an appeal of the Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam (dated
March 11, 1591) to the owners of landed property all over Ireland. The list of these
contributions is very curious, and also very liberal, if we consider that the following sums
represent perhaps eight times as much in modern days:&mdash;</p>

<p>“These sums amount to over £2,000, and they must have been considerably supplemented, for we
have a return made by Piers Nugent with respect to one of the baronies in the County of Westmeath, in
which he gives the names of eleven gentlemen in that barony who are prepared to contribute according to
their freeholds, proportionally to other freeholders of Westmeath.</p>

<p>“Money, however, came in very slowly, specially from the South of Ireland; Sir Thomas Norreys
informed Dr. Chaloner that the County of Limerick agreed to give 3s. 4d. out of every Plough-land, and
he promised to do his best to draw other counties to some contribution, but he adds, ‘I do find devotion
so cold as that I shall hereafter think it a very hard thing to compass so great a work upon so bare a
foundation.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Luke Chaloner seems to have been the active agent in corresponding with the several
contributors, and to have been most diligent in collecting subscriptions.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p></div>

<p>The coldness of Limerick&mdash;perhaps disappointed at the failure of Perrott’s scheme&mdash;contrasted
with the zeal of Dublin. Dr. Stubbs quotes from Fuller, the Church historian, a
statement which the latter had heard from credible persons then resident in Dublin, that during
the building of the College&mdash;that is to say, for over a year&mdash;it never rained, except at night.
This historically incredible statement is of real value in showing the feelings of the people who
were persuaded of it. The great interest and keen hopes of the city in the founding of the
College are expressed in this legendary way.</p>

<p>Thus by the earnestness and activity of some leading citizens of Dublin, supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the voice of educated opinion in Cambridge, the eloquence of the Archbishop, and the sound
policy of Queen Elizabeth’s advisers, Trinity College was founded. The foundation-stone was
laid by the Mayor of Dublin, Thomas Smith, and for at least 150 years the liberality of the
Corporation of Dublin was commemorated in our prayers.</p>

<p>“We give Thee thanks for the Most Serene Princess Elizabeth, our most illustrious
Foundress; for King James and King Charles, our most munificent Benefactors, and for our

<p>Such being the true history of the foundation of Trinity College, as the mother of an
University, to be a Corporation with a common seal, it was natural that upon that seal the
Corporation should assume a device implying its connection with Dublin. Accordingly,
though there is no formal record of the granting of arms to the College, the present arms,
showing it to be a place of learning, Royal and Irish, add the Castle of the Seal of the
Corporation of Dublin. Dr. Stubbs quotes (note, p. 320) a description of it in Latin elegiacs,
of which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arx ignita</i>&mdash;towers <em>fired proper</em>&mdash;are a modification of the Dublin arms,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which I
have found on illuminated rolls of the age of Charles I. preserved by the City. But this
description is undated, and although he ascribes it to the early years of the 17th century, it
will be hard to prove it older than the seal extant in clear impressions, which bears the date
1612 above the shield, and upon it the towers, not fired, but <em>domed and flagged</em>. This date
may even imply that the arms were then granted, and that it is the original form.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
recurrence of the domes and flags upon some of our earliest plate (dated 1666) gives additional
authority for this feature, nor have we any distinct or dated evidence for the <em>fired towers</em>,
adopted in the 17th century by the City also, earlier than the time of Charles II., when
they are given in a Heraldic MS. preserved in the Bermingham Tower. I have digressed
into this antiquarian matter in proof of my opening assertion that the details of the
foundation are often obscure, while the main facts are perfectly clear.</p>

THE EARLIEST EXTANT COLLEGE SEAL.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now turn from our new-founded College to cast a glance at the City of Dublin
of that day, as it is described to us by Elizabethan eye-witnesses, and as we can gather its
features from the early records of the City and the College. Mr. Gilbert has quoted from
Stanihurst’s account of Dublin, published in 1577, a curious picture of the wealth and
hospitality displayed by the several Mayors and great citizens of his acquaintance; and that
the Mayoralty was indeed a heavy tax upon the citizen who held it, appears from the
numerous applications of Mayors, recorded in the City registers, for assistance, and the
frequent voting of subsidies of £100, though care is taken to warn the citizens that this is
to establish no precedent. The City is described as very pleasant to live in, placed in an
exceptionally beautiful valley, with sea, rivers, and mountains around. Wealthy and civilised
as it was, it would have been much more so, but that the port was open, and the river full
of shoals, and that by the management of the citizen merchants a great mart of foreign
traders, which used to assemble outside the gates and undersell them, had been abolished.
The somewhat highly-coloured picture drawn by Stanihurst is severely criticised by Barnabe
Rich,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who gives a very different account, telling us that the architecture was mean, and the
whole City one mass of taverns, wherein was retailed at an enormous price, ale, which
was brewed by the richer citizens’ wives. The moral character of the retailers is
described as infamous. This liquor traffic, and the extortion of the bakers, are, to
Rich, the main features in Dublin. The Corporation records show orders concerning
the keeping of the pavements, the preserving of the purity of the water-supply, which
came from Tallaght, and the cleansing of the streets from filth and refuse thrown out of
the houses. These orders alternate with regulations to control the beggars and the swine
which swarmed in the streets. Furthermore, says Stanihurst&mdash;“There are so manie other
extraordinarie beggars that dailie swarme there, so charitablie succored, as that they make
the whole civitie in effect their hospitall.” There was a special officer, the City beadle, entitled
“master” or “warden” of the beggars, and “custos” or “overseer” of the swine, whose duty it
was to banish strange beggars from the City, and keep the swine from running about the streets.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In one of the orders relating to this subject, dated the 4th Friday after 25th December,
1601, we find the following:&mdash;“Wher[as] peticion is exhibitid by the commons, complaineing
that the auncient lawes made, debarring of swyne coming in or goeing in the streetes of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cittie, is not put in execution, by reyson whearof great danger groweth therby, as well for
infection, as also the poore infantes lieing under stales and in the streetes subject to swyne,
being a cattell much given to ravening, as well of creatures as of other thinges, and alsoe the
cittie and government therof hardlie spoken of by the State, wherin they requirid a reformacion:
it is therfore orderid and establyshid, by the aucthoritie of this assemblie, that yf eny sowe, hogge,
or pigge shalbe found or sene, ether by daie or nyght, in the streetes within the cittie walles, it
shalbe lawfull for everye man to kill the same sowe, hogge, or pigge, and after to dispose the same
at his or their disposition, without making recompence to such as owneth the same.”</p>

<p>Thus this present characteristic of the country parts of Ireland then infected the capital.
I have quoted the text of the order for reasons which will presently appear.</p>

<p>The City walls, with their many towers, and protected by a fosse, enclosed but a small
area of what we consider Old Dublin. S. Patrick’s and its Liberty, under the jurisdiction of the
Archbishop, who lived in the old Palace (S. Sepulchre’s) beside that Cathedral, was still outside
the walls, which excluded even most of Patrick Street, and was apparently defended by ramparts
of its own. Thomas Street was still a suburb, and lined with thatched houses, for we find
an order (1610) that henceforth, owing to the danger of fire<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in the suburbs, in S. Thomas
Street, S. Francis Street, in Oxmantown, or in S. Patrick Street, “noe house which shall
from hensforth be built shalbe covered with thach, but either with slate, tyle, shingle, or
boord, upon paine of x.li. current money of England.” We may therefore imagine these
suburbs as somewhat similar to those of Galway in the present day, where long streets of
thatched cabins lead up to the town. Such I take to have been the row of houses outside
Dame’s Gate, the eastern gate of the city, which is marked on the map of 1610. They
only occupy the north side of the way, and for a short distance. There had long been a
public way to Hogging or Hoggen Green, one of the three commons of the City, and the
condition of this exit from Dublin may be inferred from an order made in 1571, which the
reader will find below.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The reader will not object to have some more details about the state of this College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Green, now the very heart of the City, in the days when the College was founded. In 1576 the
great garden and gate of the deserted Monastery of All Hallowes was ordered to be allotted for
the reception of the infected, and the outer gate of All Hallowes to be repaired and locked. In
the next year (and again in 1603), it is ordered that none but citizens shall pasture their cattle on
this and the other greens. It is ordered in 1585 that no unringed swine shall be allowed to feed
upon the Green, being noisome and hurtful, and “coming on the strand greatly hinder thincrease of
the fyshe;” the tenant of All Hallowes, one Peppard, shall impound or kill them, and allow no flax
to be put into the ditches, “for avoyding the hurte to thincrease of fyshe.” In the same year the
use and keeping of the Green is leased for seven years to Mr. Nicholas Fitzsymons, to the end the
walking places may be kept clean, and no swyne or forren cattle allowed to injure them. In 1602
Sir George Carye is granted a part of the Green to build a Hospital, and presently Dr. Challoner
and others are granted another to build a Bridewell; and this is marked on the map of 1610,
near the site of the present S. Andrew’s Church.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>This is our evidence concerning the ground between the College and the City&mdash;an interval
which might well make the founders speak of the former as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juxta</i> Dublin. It was a place
unoccupied between the present Castle and College gates, with the exception of a row of cottages,
probably thatched, forming a short row at the west end and north side of Dame Street, and under
that name; opposite to this was the ruined church of S. Andrew. On the Green were pigs and
cattle grazing; refuse of various kinds was cast out in front of the houses of Dame Street,
despite the Corporation order; a little stream crossed this space close to the present College
gate, and the only two buildings close at hand, when the student looked out of his window
or over the wall, were a hospital for the infected, by the river, and a bridewell on his way
to the City.</p>

<p>Further off, the view was interesting enough. The walled City, with its gates,
crowned the hill of Christ Church, and the four towers of the Castle were plainly visible.
A gate, over a fosse, led into the City, where first of all there lay on the left hand the Castle
entrance, with the ghastly heads of great rebels still exposed on high poles. Here the
Lord Deputy and his men-at-arms kept their state, and hither the loyal gentry from the
country came to express their devotion and obtain favours from the Crown. In the far
distance to the south lay the Dublin and Wicklow mountains, not as they now are, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
delightful excursion for the student on his holiday, but the home of those wild Irish whose
raids up to the City walls were commemorated by the feast of Black Monday at Cullenswood,
whither the citizens went well guarded, and caroused, to assert themselves against the natives
who had once surprised and massacred 500 of them close to that wood. The river, the sea,
and the Hill of Howth, held by the Baron of Howth in his Castle, closed the view to the
east. The upland slopes to the north were near no wild country, and therefore Oxmantown
and S. Mary’s Abbey were already settled on the other bank of the river.</p>

<p>We must remember also, as regards the civilisation of Dublin, that though the streets
swarmed not only with beggars and swine, but with rude strangers from the far country, yet
the wealthy citizens were not only rich and hospitable, but advanced enough to send their
sons to Cambridge. This is proved by the Usshers and Challoners, and we may be sure
these were not solitary cases. As regards education, there are free schools and grammar schools
constantly mentioned in the records of the time. It is well known that one Fullerton, a very
competent Scotchman, was sent over by James VI. of Scotland to promote that King’s interests,
and that he had a Hamilton for his assistant, who afterwards got great grants of land for
himself, as Lord Clandeboye, and also obtained for the College those Crown rents which
resulted in producing its great wealth. Fullerton, a learned man, was ultimately placed in the
King’s household. Both were early nominated lay Fellows of the College. These were
people of education who understood how to teach.</p>

<p>But most probably the great want in Dublin was the want of books. There must
have been a very widespread complaint of this, when it occurred to the army which
had defeated the Spaniards at Kinsale (in 1601) to give a large sum from their spoil for
books to endow the new College.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This sent the famous James Ussher to search for books in
England, and laid the foundation for that splendid collection of which the Archbishop’s own
books formed the next great increase, obtained by the new military donation of Cromwell’s
soldiers in 1654. There is probably no other so great library in the world endowed by the
repeated liberality of soldiers. Still we hear that, even after the founding of the collection,
James Ussher thought it necessary to go every third year to England, and to spend in reading
a month at Oxford, a month at Cambridge, and a month in London, for the purpose of adding
to that mass of his learning which most of us would think already excessive. Yet it is a pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that smaller men, in more recent days, did not follow his example, and so save the College
from that provincialism with which it was infected even in our own recollection.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the internal history of the College. The great crises in the first
century of its existence were the Rebellion under Charles I. and the civil war under James II.,
ending with the Settlements by which Charles II. and William III. secured the future
greatness of the Institution. This brief sketch cannot enter into details, especially into
the tedious internal quarrels of the Provost and Fellows; we are only concerned with the
general character of the place, its religion, its morals, and its intellectual tendencies. Upon
all these questions we have hitherto rather been put off with details than with a philosophical
survey of what the College accomplished.</p>

<p>It has been well insisted on by Mr. Heron, the Roman Catholic historian of Trinity
College, that the Charter of Elizabeth is neither exclusive nor bigoted as regards creed.
Religion, civility, and learning are the objects to be promoted, and it is notorious that the great
Queen’s policy, as regards the first, was to insist upon outward conformity with the State
religion without further inquisition. A considerable number of the Corporation which endowed
the new College were Roman Catholics, and we know that even the Usshers had near relations
of that creed. There <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'was no insistance'">was no insistence</ins> that the Fellows should take orders&mdash;we know that
Provost Temple, and Fullerton and Hamilton, among the earliest Fellows, were laymen,&mdash;and
though in very early days the degree of Doctor conferred was apparently always that in
Theology, the Charter provides for all the Faculties, and it was soon felt that Theology
and the training of clergy were becoming too exclusively the work of the place. The
constant advices from Chancellors and from other advisers to give special advantages to the
natives, and the repeated attempts to teach the Irish language, and through its medium to
educate the Irish, show plainly that they understood Elizabeth’s foundation as intended
for the whole country, and more especially for those of doubtful loyalty in their creed, who
were tempted to go abroad for their education.</p>

<p>“A certain illustrious Baron,” says Father Fitz-Simons, writing in 1603, “whose lady,
my principal benefactress, sent his son to Trinity College. Notwithstanding my obligations
to them for my support, I, with the utmost freedom, earnestness, and severity, informed and
taught them, that it was a most impious thing, and a detestable scandal, to expose their
child to such education. The boy was taken away at once, and so were others, after that
good example. The College authorities are greatly enraged at this, as they had never before
attracted any [Roman Catholic] pupil of respectability, and do not now hope to get any for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the future. Hence I must be prepared for all the persecution which their impiety and
hatred can bring down upon me.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the early Provosts imported from Cambridge, Travers, Alvey, Temple,
were men who were baulked in their English promotion by their acknowledged Puritanism&mdash;a
school created or promoted by that desperate bigot Cartwright, who preached the most violent
Genevan doctrines from his Chair of Divinity in Cambridge. But these men, who certainly were
second to none in the intolerance of their principles, were themselves in danger of persecution from
the Episcopal party in England. Complaints were urged against Temple for neglecting to wear
a surplice in Chapel&mdash;a great stumbling-block in those days; the Puritanism of the College was
openly assailed, so that its Governors were rather occupied in defending themselves than in
attacking the creed of others. Any sect which is in danger of persecution is compelled so far to
advocate toleration; we may be sure that the Irish Fellows who lived among Catholics in a
Catholic nation curbed any excessive zeal on the part of the Puritan Provosts; and so we find
that they did not scruple to admit natives whom they suspected, or even knew, to be Papists.
Moreover, the Fellows and their Provost were very busy in constitution-mongering. They had
the power by Charter of making and altering statutes&mdash;a source of perpetual dispute; and,
besides, the Plantation of Ulster by James I. in 1610 gave them their first large estates, which
were secured to them by the influence of Fullerton and Hamilton, already mentioned as Scottish
agents of the King. Provost Temple spent most of his time either in framing statutes or in
quarrelling about leases with his Fellows.</p>

<p>A review of the various documents still extant concerning these quarrels shows that
the first of the lay Provosts was not inferior in importance to his two successors in the eighteenth
century, and that in his day all the main problems which have since agitated the Corporation
were raised and discussed.</p>

<p>In the first place we may name the distinction between University and College, one often
attempted by theorists, and which may any day become of serious importance if a new College
were founded under the University, but one which has practically had no influence in the history
of Trinity College. We even find such hybrid titles as Fellow of the University, and Professor
of the College, used by people who ought to have known the impropriety.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Temple, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
consent of his Fellows, sought to obtain a separate Charter for a University, and drew up,
for this and the College, Statutes which Dr. Stubbs has quoted.</p>

<p>The second point in Temple’s policy was an innovation which took root, and transformed
the whole history of the College. It was the distinction of Senior and junior Fellows, not merely
into separate classes as regards salary and duties, but into Governors and subjects. It was
rightly felt that, after some years’ constant lecturing, the Fellows who still adhered to the
College should have leisure for their studies, and for literary work, as well as a better
income, in reward of their services. But when Temple made a College Statute that the Seniors
should govern not only the scholars and ordinary students, but also the Junior Fellows and
Probationers (which last correspond somewhat to our present Non-Tutor Fellows), he soon came
into conflict with the Charter, which gave many privileges&mdash;the election, for example, of the
Provost&mdash;to all the Fellows without distinction; and on this question arose a great dispute
immediately on Temple’s death, there being actually two Provosts elected&mdash;one (Mede) by the
Seniors, the other (R. Ussher) by the Juniors. Bedell was only elected by a compromise between
the two parties, with distinct protests on the part of the Juniors.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The Caroline Statutes finally
decided the matter, and gave the whole control to the Seniors.</p>

<p>Whether this great change, introduced by Temple, and certainly promoted by Ussher, has
been a benefit or an injury to the College, is a question not easy to answer. There is no
doubt that a small body, such as the Governing Board of Provost and Senior Fellows, is far more
likely to carry out a consistent policy, and even to decide promptly, where discussion and
divergence of opinion among a larger number cause delay and paralyse action. But, on the
other hand, the concentration of power into the hands of a small and irremovable body sets
temptations before its members to look after their own interests unduly, and cumulate upon
themselves offices and emoluments to the damage of the Corporation.</p>

<p>The reservation of a large number of offices to the Senior Fellows, and the consequent
appointment, occasionally, of incompetent persons to discharge important duties, were the
necessary result of such an arrangement, and might be of great injury to the Corporation.
It might even result in the trafficking in offices, or in acts of distinct injustice towards the
other members of the Corporation, which could not have been committed had the acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the Governing Body been subject to the public criticism and control of the whole body of
Fellows.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as some working Committee must be selected to administer the affairs
of the College, nothing was more obvious to Temple or to Ussher than that those who had
been Fellows for eight or ten years should be preferred to those who had just entered the
Corporation. In a body, however, of celibates, with many good livings and other promotions
around them, it never occurred to the framers of the Statute that new circumstances would arise
which made a Fellowship practically a life office, and thus placed the government in the hands of
a group of men, of whom many were disabled by age, and, moreover, distracted by family cares.
We should not stare with more wonder at a Vice-Provost of 40, than would Ussher have stared
at a Junior Fellow of 40 years’ standing. Had such things been even dimly foreseen, it would
have been easy to avoid the danger of accumulating emolument and office upon incompetent
persons by making the Governing Body elective from the whole Corporation.</p>

<p>The third question which arose in Provost Temple’s day was the proper leasing of
the College estates. The tendency to take present profit at the expense of our successors, or to
postpone the interests of the abstract Corporation to the claims of private friendship, is nowhere
more conspicuous than in the document Dr. Stubbs has printed (p. 32), in which the Provost, and
two Senior Fellows, the greatest names at the foundation, and the most attached friends of the
College, James Ussher and Luke Challoner, actually consent to lease for ever all the Ulster estates
to Sir James Hamilton, their old personal friend and colleague, who had helped the College to
obtain these lands from the King. Had the earnest endeavours of these two excellent Senior
Fellows been carried out, the College would not have owned nearly so many hundreds, as it now
owns thousands, in Ulster. This calamity was only averted by the active interference of the
Junior Fellows, who obtained an order from the State forbidding the Board to give perpetual
leases. Nevertheless, so long as the Senior Fellows divided the renewal fines, there was constant
danger of the rents of the College being cut down, and the incomes of the lessors being increased:
it redounds to the credit of this “Venetian Council” that, after such vast opportunities of
plundering public property, only some few cases of breach of public trust can be asserted against
them. One of the most manifest attempts has been just noticed. Another was partly carried through
by Temple. He obtained a lease, and appointed his son Seneschal of the Manor of Slutmulrooney&mdash;a
delightful title, but also a solid estate, which he evidently coveted for a family property.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>We turn with satisfaction from such things to the two great names in the College and the
Irish Church which mark that period&mdash;Bedell and James Ussher.</p>

<p>It was by rare good fortune that the nascent College secured such a student as James
Ussher. He must have made a name in any case; yet the world is so apt to judge any system
not by the average outcome, but by the best and worst, that one such name was at that moment
of the last importance. He was the first great home growth, and, though he refused the Provostship,
he was so closely connected with the College as Fellow, Lecturer in Divinity, as Vice-Provost
and as Vice-Chancellor, that no one has ever thought of denying him and his fame
to the College. His works and character will be discussed in another chapter. What I am
concerned with is his attitude in the great ecclesiastical quarrels of the day. It was no easy course
to steer the Church of Ireland between the “Scylla of Puritanism” and the “Charybdis of Popery.”
Ussher well knew that both were dangerous enemies. In his youth, owing to his daily contact
with Roman Catholic relatives, with Jesuit controversialists, with the temporising policy of King
James, who offered further stages of toleration in return for subsidies of money from the Irish
Catholics, he was strong against the danger on that side, and protested with prophetic wisdom
that such concessions would lead to rebellion and ruin in Ireland. In his old age, when living
constantly, either from his public importance or his persecutions, in England, when witnessing
and suffering from the outrages of the English Revolution, he said in a conversation with Evelyn,
“that the Church would be destroyed by sectaries who would in all likelihood bring in Popery.”
The personal complexion of his religion, his constant preaching, his great liberality and good
feeling towards pious Dissenting ministers, show that he was a strong Protestant, and he always
showed the strongest apprehension of the ambitious policy of the Romish priesthood, which he
feared as a pressing danger; but, nevertheless, he was so loyal a Churchman, that he was content
to overlook many abuses in the system which he administered.</p>

<p>It was this temper, so common in the Anglo-Irish Protestant, which separates him in
his policy from his eminent and amiable contemporary, Bishop Bedell. But the latter was a
stranger brought over from England to be Provost, who, with all the generosity and all the
kindliness of his noble nature, set himself to instruct the native Irish, and to work out the regeneration
of these barbarians by teaching them religion through the Irish language. So sterling and
single-hearted was the Bishop, that even the excited rebels of 1641, amid their rapine and
massacre, spared and respected the excellent old man, and at his death honoured him with a
great public funeral. But it is plain from Primate Ussher’s dealings with him that this policy of
persuading the natives was not to the Primate’s taste. Ussher probably believed that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
were serious dangers in the policy of reclaiming the natives through kindness, and their priests
through persuasion; and if the historians note it as curious that, of all those who ruled the
College, those by far the most anxious to promote Irish studies were two Englishmen,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Bedell
and Marsh, it will be replied by many in Ireland, that this contrast between the views of the
English stranger, and of the English settler who knows the country, is still perpetuated.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the attitude of the early rulers of the College, and such their controversies.
All of them that were not complete Puritans felt what Provost Chappel says in his autobiographical
(iambic) poem&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ruunt agmine facto in me profana turba Roma Genevaque</i>. But
from the very commencement the College was Puritanical enough to save it from Ecclesiasticism.
There is therefore nothing strange in the habit of making lay Fellows read short
sermons (commonplaces) in the Chapel as part of their duty&mdash;a practice only abandoned
within the memory of our seniors in this century.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>We turn to the few and meagre traditions concerning the moral condition and conduct of
the students. It must be remembered that they came up at a very early age&mdash;12 to 14 years
old are often mentioned&mdash;and were only supposed to be partly educated when they took their B.A.
degree. There were special exercises and lectures for three years more, and only with the M.A.
were they properly qualified. We may, indeed, be sure that the post-graduate studies were far
the more important for the serious section of the lads. For they came up very raw and ignorant;
they even had a special schoolmaster to teach them the elements of Latin and Greek, and of
course the books they could command were both few and imperfect as educational helps. I do
not think that from the first the College was at all abandoned to the poor or inferior classes. The
very earliest lists of names contain those of the most respectable citizens; there were often
favourite pupils of a Provost, or other Don, who came from England, brought over with their
teacher. Very soon the Irish nobility began to send their sons. The Court of Wards,
established by King James I. in 1617, ordered that the minors of important families in Ireland
should be maintained and educated in English habits, and in Trinity College, Dublin; and the
first instance of this kind is that of Farrall O’Gara, heir to Moy Gara, County Sligo, who was to
remain at the College from his 12th to his 18th year. By this means many youths of quality,
or at least of important family, were enrolled among the students. The Earl of Cork sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
two sons in 1630; the famous Strafford two in 1637; and we find Radcliffes, Wandesfords, and
other aristocratic names. What strikes us in the face of this is the extreme economy&mdash;or
rather the apparently very small prices mentioned in the various early accounts printed by
Dr. Stubbs from the Bursar’s books.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This economy, however, only applies to the scholars supported by the House, especially
the <em>natives</em>, who had various privileges. Fellow-Commoners, and Nobles, such as Strafford’s
sons, were probably allowed various indulgences. It is interesting to notice that from the
first a certain proportion of lads came, as they now do, from the counties of England
(especially Cheshire) nearest to Dublin. On the other hand, while natives are carefully
distinguished from lads born in Ireland, I cannot find what test was applied to determine
a “native.” Even in 1613, 20 out of the 65 students are so denominated. The majority
of the natives, says Archbishop Marsh two generations later, had been born of English
parents, and were mostly of the meaner sort, but by having learned to speak Irish with their
Irish nurses, or fosterers, had acquired some knowledge of the vernacular. But they could not
read or write it. The names quoted by Bedell in 1628 suggest that this account of the parentage
is true. Conway, Baker, Davis, and Burton are admonished for being absent from Irish prayers.
These are not Irish names. It is also added by Marsh that most of these native scholars, bred
in the College, turned Papists in James II.’s reign. This proves that they had Irish mothers,
and would have afforded James Ussher a strong confirmation for his policy as against Bedell’s.</p>

<p>This society of students was then, as it has ever since been, very various in race, social
position, and parentage, and to this not a little of its great intellectual activity may be traced.
It should also be added here that one of the strongest natural reasons for the great prominence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the Anglo-Irish, and the extraordinary distinctions they have attained in every great development
of the British Empire, is that the English settlers of Elizabethan and Jacobean
days were the boldest adventurers, the young men (often of good family) of the greatest
energy and courage, to be found among the youth of England. They came to incur great
risks, to brave many dangers, but to attain great rewards. The rapidity of promotion among
the ecclesiastics, for example, is quite astonishing: Bishops at 30, Archbishops and Chancellors
at 40, are not uncommon. And if these daring adventurers were often unscrupulous, at all
events they and their quick-witted Irish wives produced a most uncommon offspring.</p>

<p>We do not find that any hereditary turbulence showed itself in disorders among the
students. The early quarrels recorded are all among the Fellows, and upon constitutional
questions. The main complaints against the boys were very harmless freaks, if we except the
constant apprehensions of the Deans concerning ale or tippling houses in the city, which were
assumed to be haunts of vice. Stealing apples and cherries from the surrounding orchards was
a common offence, coupled, moreover, with climbing over the wall of the College. It shows
Ussher’s hand when we find this local feature formally noted in the Caroline Statutes. A
few of Bedell’s entries are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>1628. July 16</em> and <em>18.</em>&mdash;At the examinations each forme was censured, and it was agreed that none
shall ascend out of one forme to another, however absent, till he be examined.</p>

<p><em>August 21.</em>&mdash;The Bachelors to be hearers of the Hebrew Lecture, unless they that were
able to proceed in that tongue by their private industry, and those are to help in the collation
of the <span class="fs70">MSS.</span> of the New Testament in Greek. Twelve Testaments were given by Sir William Ussher
for the Irish.</p>

<p><em>August 24.</em>&mdash;A meeting about the accounts. Warning given of town haunting and swearing. The
Deans requested to appoint secret monitors for them.</p>

<p><em>September 13.</em>&mdash;The Dean may punish for going in cloaks by the consent of the Provost and greater
part. Mr. Temple’s letters to the Provost and Fellows answered&mdash;his cause of absence to study in Oxford
not <em>gravis</em> much less <em>gravissima</em>.</p>

<p><em>September 22.</em>&mdash;The course for banishing boys, not students, by occasion of Mr. Lowther’s boy
striking Johnson consented to, viz. that fire and water, bread and beer and meat be denied them by the
butler and cook, under pain of 12d. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toties quoties</i>.</p>

<p><em>September 23.</em>&mdash;Deane and Wilson mulcted a month’s Commons for their insolent behaviour,
assaulting and striking the butler, which was presently changed into sitting at the lower end of the Scholars’
table for a month, and subjecting them to the rod.</p>

<p>The order for placing the Fellow Commoners by themselves in the Chapel for having more room
begins. Service books bought and bound for the natives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><em>October.</em>&mdash;Election of Burgesses for Parliament. The Provost and Mr. Donellan, upon better advice,

<p><em>December 28.</em>&mdash;The Lord Primate dined in the College at the Hall, and the same Dr. James Ware
presented the petition for renewing the lands of Kilmacrenny. Jo. Wittar admonished for playing at cards.</p>

<p><em>January 28.</em>&mdash;Tho. Walworth refused to read Chapter, and enjoined to make a confession of his
fault upon his knees in the Hall&mdash;which he disacknowledging&mdash;he had deserved expulsion.</p>

<p><em>July 23, 1629.</em>&mdash;Sir Walworth said to have sold his study to haunt the town. Somers, Deane, and
Elliott appointed to sit bare for going out of the Hall before grace, and not performing it, made to

<p><em>April 2.</em>&mdash;The proclamation against Priests and Jesuits came forth.</p>

<p><em>April 5.</em>&mdash;Easter day, at which the forms were used for conveniency about the Communion Table.</p>

<p><em>April 11.</em>&mdash;Mr. Travers, for omitting his Common place the second time appointed, punished 13s.
Mr. Tho. for omitting prayers reading, 5s.</p>

<p><em>May 12.</em>&mdash;The Sophisters proposed supper to the Bachelors: prevented by sending for them and
forbidding them to attempt it.</p>

<p><em>July 11.</em>&mdash;The Fellow Commoners complain of Mr. Price for forbidding them to play at bowls in the

and Burton, admonished for being often absent from Irish Prayers.</p>

<p><em>August 19.</em>&mdash;The natives to lose their weekly allowance if they are absent from prayers on the
Lord’s Day.</p>

<p><em>August 29.</em>&mdash;Sir Springham said to keep a hawk. Rawley, for drunkenness and knocking Strank’s
head against the seat of the Chapel, to have no further maintenance from the house.</p>

<p>Booth, for taking a pig of Sir Samuel Smith’s, and that openly in the day time before many, and
causing it to be dressed in town, inviting Mr. Rollon and Sir Conway (who knew not of it) was condemned
to be whipped openly in the Hall, and to pay for the pig.</p>

<p><em>August 6.</em>&mdash;Communion. Sermon upon Psalm 71. 16. The Articles of the Church of Ireland read.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<p>The entries of the 29th August (1629) are peculiarly interesting, but have hitherto not been
understood in their local connection. There is an entry in Mr. Gilbert’s <cite>Assembly Roll</cite> (ii., p. 82)
awarding a citizen £8 for a goshawk he had purchased for the city, which hawk had died. This
is a very large sum&mdash;perhaps equal to £70 now, and out of all proportion to the salaries and the
prices of necessaries in the College. To keep a hawk was, therefore, somewhat like keeping an
expensive hunter now, and a proof of great extravagance. As regards the story of the pig, it was
nothing more than a comic carrying out of an order (above, <a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>) frequently issued by the
Corporation, whom Booth took at their word. It seems, therefore, that either such proclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
were a sham, or that they only referred to the right of citizens to interfere with the
roving swine.</p>

THE SOUTH BACK OF THE<br />ELIZABETHAN COLLEGE.</div>
</div>

<p>The courts seem to have been in grass, as there is an early item for mowing, and 1s. 4d. for
an old scythe. A vegetable garden was kept for the use of the College on the site of the present
Botany Bay Square, and the further ground belonging to the precincts is called a firr park, which
seems to mean a field of furze, much used for fuel in those days. There was neither room nor
permission for the games and sports so vital to modern College life. The old and strict notion
of a College life, still preserved in some Roman Catholic Colleges abroad, excluded all
recreation as waste of time. The Caroline
Statutes formally forbid playing or
even loitering in the courts or gardens
of the College. Nor was this any
isolated severity. In the detailed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horarium</i> laid down for a proposed
College at Ripon, to be founded by
James I.’s Queen (Anne of Denmark)
at this very time, every half-hour in
the day is fully occupied with study,
lectures, or prayers.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> There was considerable
license, however, allowed at
Christmas, and it was perhaps from the
old Monastery of All Hallowes that the
fashion was transmitted of acting plays
at that season in the College. The performance seems to have been undertaken by the several
years or classes. In 1630 it was ordered that the play should be acted, but not in the College.
The Lord Deputy constrained the unwilling Provost Ussher to permit it. Even in the Caroline
Statutes, remains of this Christmas license appear in the permission to play cards&mdash;at other times
strictly forbidden&mdash;in the Hall on that day. Every 17th March (S. Patrick’s Day), the town
population came in crowds from the city to S. Patrick’s well at the southern limit of the College
(now Nassau Street, opposite Dawson Street), there to test the miraculous powers of that holy
well, which at that moment of the year worked strange cures of diseases. We can imagine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
furze bushes or trees around this well all hung with tattered rags, as may still be seen at wells of
similar pretensions in the wild parts of Ireland. If the enclosed S. Stephen’s Green was still
remarkable in the last century “for the incredible number of snipes” that frequented it, so the
College Park must have contained them in abundance. But it was reserved for our grandfathers
to boast that they had shot a snipe in the College precincts.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The intellectual condition of the average 16th century student is even harder to
ascertain, and I have sought in vain for adequate materials. It does, indeed, appear that
the Irish New Testament and Prayer Book had been printed. Sir H. Sidney’s <cite>Irish Articles
of Religion</cite> were brought out in 1566. John Ussher had promoted Kearney’s <cite>Irish Alphabet
and Catechism</cite>, produced in Dublin from type supplied by the Queen in 1571.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> William
Ussher had produced the New Testament in Francke’s printing, 1602. This printer is
probably the man mentioned as the “King’s printer” in 1615 (for proclamations?). But
though there is extant a proposed arrangement with the very printer of one of these books
(Kearney) to live and work in the College,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> there is no trace of his having done any
real service. Even the Statutes were in MS., copied out by the hand of the Provost
or Vice-Provost. The annals of Dublin show, I believe, none but isolated printing till
about 1627;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> it was in 1641, both in Kilkenny and Waterford, as well as in Dublin, that
printing began to be used for disseminating political views. But the earliest students must have
found it very difficult to obtain books, and there is no trace that any printing press started
up to meet this urgent want. I am now speaking only of text-books for students,
by which I mean such small and handy editions as the Latin <cite>Isagoge</cite> of Porphyry, printed
at Paris in 1535, of which copies are often found in Dublin, as the work was diligently
taught in the 17th century course. Dudley Loftus’ <cite>Logic</cite> and <cite>Introduction</cite>, printed in 1657
(Dublin), seem to me the earliest books likely to have been used as text-books in
Trinity College. Strange to say, there is no copy of either in our College Library. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the official teaching was strictly oral, and the students were merely required to write out in
theses or reproduce in disputations what their tutors had told them. The College course, as
laid down by Laud (or Ussher?) in the Caroline Statutes, is plainly not a course in books,
but in subjects. Not a single text-book, unless it be the <cite>Isagoge</cite> of Porphyry, is specified,
and this rather for the lecturer than the students. Whatever practical relaxations the course
then laid down may have undergone, it was chiefly in the post-graduate studies; for the officers
of the College had no power to alter or emend the programme of Laud till the year 1760,
when a special King’s Letter gave them authority to do so. This accounts for the great
quantity of lecturing which went on, each tutor giving three hours every day, not to speak of the
efforts of the College Schoolmaster, who undertook those that were raw in Latin and Greek.
Archbishop Loftus, indeed, in his parting address to the College (Armagh Library MS.), exhorts
the new Provost (Travers)&mdash;“See that the younger sort be well catechised, and that you prescribe to
the rest a catalogue of approved books to be read by them as foundations of learning, both human
and divine.” But this alludes to post-graduate studies, for which the Library was then established,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and not to the daily studies of the undergraduates. Logic was the chief subject, the
system of Ramus being brought into fashion by the Cambridge Puritans, and especially by
Provost Temple, who had written a book on the subject. Chappel was also a famous Ramist
logician. Very little mathematics was taught, but, on the other hand, Hebrew was regarded as
of equal importance with Greek; and in every subject we find the student’s knowledge tested,
not by reproduction of his reading, but by disputations, which showed that he had so far grasped
a subject that he could attack an adversary or defend himself when attacked.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The writer of the first four chapters here acknowledges the generous help received from J. R. Garstin, Esq., B.D.,
and the Rev. William Reynell, B.D., both in supplying him with facts and in correcting his proofs. This portion of the
book was undertaken by him suddenly, in default of a specialist to perform it. Hence the large number of extracts
inserted, in which the facts must rest upon the authority of the authors quoted, as there was no time to verify them. Of
the three extant histories of the University, those of Taylor and of Dr. Stubbs are very valuable in citing many original
documents, the former chiefly Parliamentary, the latter from the archives of the College. Heron’s work was written for
a special purpose, which he pleads throughout, after the manner of his profession.</p></div>

country, ... and the ablest scholars of the nation preferred to be professors and teachers therein, without any
distinction of orders, congregations, or politic bodies other than that of true merit,” etc. <em>Cf.</em> <cite>Dublin Magazine</cite> for August,
1762. This golden age of Irish University education may well be relegated to the other golden ages of mythology.</p></div>

who lent me the late Bishop of Down’s MS. copy:&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nolui enim Magnatum placitis me accomodare qui summo conatu, immo

thrashed by Perrott for opposing him! And he retorts the very charge brought against himself, of having pecuniary interests in
the background.</p></div>

M.A. in 1589. He was never a Fellow, or even a Scholar, of Trinity College, Cambridge, and obtained his D.D. at one of the

foreign Colleges founded by Irish priests for the Irish at this very time in Salamanca (opened 1592), Lisbon (1593),
Douai (1594). Thus there was an active policy to be counteracted by Elizabeth, and these proposed foundations were
probably set before her by Henry Ussher as a pressing danger. Some account of the Constitution of the Salamanca
seminary is given in Hogan’s <cite>Hibernia Ignatiana</cite>, Appendix, p. 238. The students were to be exclusively of Irish parentage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Who these well-disposed persons were is beyond doubt. The Queen mentions Ussher in the Warrant; the College
mentions Challoner on his tomb&mdash;

<p class="verse0">Cujus ope et precibus conditur ista domus.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>
James Ussher, in recommending a subsequent Provost (Robert Ussher), says&mdash;“He is the son of that father at whose instance,
charge, and trust the Charter of the first foundation was obtained from Queen Elizabeth” (<cite>Works</cite>, i., 103). On the epitaph of
Provost Seele we read&mdash;

</div></div>

<p>
In the MS. at Armagh, written in praise of Loftus, and reporting his speeches, we have the following (p. 228):&mdash;“Among
many prudent inducements suitable to polity and reason which moved the Queen to establish this University and College at All
Hallowes, the humble peticion of Henry Ussher, Archdeacon of Dublin, in the name of the Citty of Dublin, faithfully and most
zealously solicited by Dr. Luke Challoner, and as powerfully recommended and promoted by Adam Loftus, etc., was not held
the least of efficacye as to extrinsicall impressions with the Queen in that behalf.” Here, then, <em>in a panegyric of Loftus</em>, Archbishop
and Chancellor, his name is postponed to those of the two local men and the City of Dublin. This fact speaks for
itself. I quote these various documents to correct the current impression that Loftus was the real founder.</p></div>

a Charter and Statutes for the University, as distinguished from the College. This scheme, when almost complete, was
adjourned <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>. But if the original seal contained any allusion to Trinity College as an University, which is very
possible, then this seal, dated 1612, is the first seal of the College as such, and there may have been another seal
prepared for the University, which disappeared with the failure of the scheme.</p></div>

allowance will be to each Scholar, out of the kitchen, 1s. 2½d. per week, or £2 13s. 1d. per annum. After this rate,
there being seventeen and a-half messes of Scholars, and for each mess 3d. at dinner, and 4d. at supper, the allowance out
of the kitchen, made to seventy Scholars, will amount to £185 15s. per annum. The allowance to a Scholar out of the
buttery. To each Scholar allowed in bread, at dinner ½d., and at supper a ½d., and for his weekly sizings 4d., it cometh
to 11d. per week; To each Scholar, in beer, ½d. per diem is per week, 3½d. At this rate a Scholar’s allowance, out of
the buttery, in bread and beer is 1s. 2½d. per week, or £3 2s. 10d. per annum. Now the whole allowance of a Scholar,
both out of the kitchen and buttery, being 2s. 2¼d. per week, and £5 15s. 11d. per annum, will amount for seventy
Scholars, to £405 3s. 4d.
</p>
<p>
“The allowance of a Fellow out of the kitchen, 1½d. per each meal, or 3d. per diem, will come to 1s. 9d. per
week or £4 11s. per annum: according to this rate, there being four messes of Fellows, and for each mess, both dinner
and supper, 6d., the allowance of the Fellows out of the kitchen will be £72 16s. per annum. The allowance of a Fellow
out of the buttery at 1d. each for bread, and 1d. for beer, and for his weekly sizings 1½d., will be 1s. 3½d. each, and
per annum £3 7s. 2d.: after this the allowances of the sixteen Fellows out of the buttery in bread, beer, and sizings, is
£53 14s. 8d. per annum.”&mdash;<em>Op. cit.</em> p. 40. The details sorely need explanation.</p></div>

<div><img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_041b.jpg" width="90" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">The first fifty years of this History passed away without much apparent
advance. The attempt to supply additional room by providing two
residence-halls in the city (Bridge Street and Back Lane) turned out a complete
failure.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> As the College grew richer by King James’ gifts of Ulster lands,
the quarrels of the Fellows and Provost were increased by this new interest. They
were also still constitution-mongering, and we do not find that the only Dublin man, Robert
Ussher, who was Provost during this period, was more successful than the imported Cambridge
men. Among the Fellows appointed, if we except the remarkable group of founders, not a single
name of note appears save Joshua Hoyle, who came from Oxford, and who was afterwards
Professor of Divinity, and Master of University College, Oxford. The rest supplied the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of Ireland with some respectable dignitaries, but nothing more. We know that these things
were weighing on the mind of the great Primate, who could remember the high hopes and
the enthusiasm of Dublin when the College was founded. He was convinced that the
Fellows wasted their energies in College politics, and that the Provost had insufficient
powers to control them. Laud surely speaks the words of Ussher when he says that the
College is reported to him as “being as ill-governed as any in Christendom.”
Archbishop Ussher must have been determined to take from the Fellows the management
of their own affairs, and entrust it to a Provost nominated by the Crown, administering
Statutes fixed by the Crown, and only to be altered with its sanction. This great reform he
carried out by having his friend Archbishop Laud appointed Chancellor, and so having a
new Charter forced, in 1637, upon the College&mdash;the Caroline Statutes.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was indeed a
strong measure to take from the College its self-government, but it was done after due
deliberation by wise men; and the results have certainly answered their expectations. It
should, however, be added, in fairness to those who failed during the first 45 years to
maintain order, that the Crown, while professing to give absolute liberty by Statute, had
constantly interfered in appointments, and violated the privileges granted by Elizabeth.
Nor indeed did the Caroline Statutes, which much internal evidence shows to be the
work of Ussher as well as Laud, succeed forthwith. The experiment was baulked at
the outset by the unfortunate appointment of Chappel as Provost, a famous logician, but a
weak and not very honest man,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> whose conduct was about to be impeached by the Irish
Parliament, when the Rebellion of 1641 burst upon the land. Chappel was then Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Cork, but had refused to resign the Provostship. Ten years of misery supervened, when
Chappel and the next Provost, Wassington, fled home to England, when Faithful Tate and
Dudley Loftus strove as vice-regents to hold together the affairs of the starving College;
when the estates were in the rebels’ hands, the valuable plate was pawned or melted,
Provost Martin dying of the plague which followed upon massacre and starvation:<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> the
intellectual heart of Ireland suffered with its members, and responded to the agonies of
the loyal population with sufferings not less poignant.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the appointment of the Lord Deputy, Ormonde (a great benefactor
to the College at the worst moment), as Chancellor is dated the 12th March, 1644.
He was chosen to succeed Laud. The actual deed is now at Kilkenny Castle.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The
appointment of the Chancellor was made by the Provost (Anthony Martin, Bishop of Meath)
and a majority of the Senior Fellows. Ormonde came back with the Restoration, and in
high favour.</p>

<p>The horror of civil war in England was added to make the cup flow over. Charles, Laud,
and Ussher were too engrossed with their own troubles to promote the regeneration of the
College which they had commenced, and so we find that this decennium of anarchy was only
ended by the strong hand of Cromwell, who undertook to establish order in Ireland. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
“crowd of Geneva” were accordingly established in the College; but justice must admit that
Henry Cromwell as Chancellor, and Winter as Provost, behaved with good sense and zeal in
promoting the interests of learning. They, of course, pressed home their doctrines upon the
students; Winter called to the College zealous controversialists of distinguished piety;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> private
Christian meetings among the students were encouraged rather than official Chapels. Such of
the former officers as acquiesced in these things&mdash;the Vice-Chancellor Henry Jones, who dropped
his title of Bishop, and Stearne the physician&mdash;were continued for the sake of their learning. The
care of outward neatness appears from the entries forbidding linen to be dried in the courts;
they had washed it there long enough. The Provost undertook several journeys to the remote
parts of Ireland, to recover the abandoned properties and collect the rents of the College. To
the Commonwealth, moreover, is due the foundation (1652) of the School of Mathematics, which
has since become so famous. This initial step was advanced by the bequest of Lord Donegal
(1660), whose Lecturership is still known by his name.</p>

<p>When the Restoration supervened, Winter and his intimates were expelled as intruders,
and a new governing body and scholars appointed. But as Cromwell had taken care
to keep up the traditions of the College by continuing some of the previous Fellows, so the
Government of Charles II. reappointed several men who had stood by the College all through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the interregnum, and saved the continuity of its teaching. Above all, the framers of the well-known
Act of Settlement took special care of the College, securing to it all the estates to which
it had a claim, and even endowing the Provost with charges upon forfeited lands in the Archbishopric
of Dublin. Provisions were made for the founding of a second College under the
University; presently Dr. Stearne obtained a Charter for the College of Physicians at Trinity
Hall, close to the Green, in connection with the College. Ussher’s books, which were still lying
in Dublin Castle, though long since purchased by Cromwell’s soldiers for the College, were now
formally handed over to it; and in every way its interests were fostered and promoted. The
Duke of Ormonde as Lord Deputy, and also as Chancellor of the University, and Bishop Jeremy
Taylor as Vice-Chancellor, may be regarded as the main movers in this policy; whether other
secret influences were at work I have not been able to ascertain.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> How firm and wise a
friend of the College Ormonde was, appears from the following protest he made to the then
Secretary of State. An Englishman had just been nominated to an Irish bishopric. “It is fit
that it should be remembered that near this city there is an University of the foundation of
Queen Elizabeth, principally intended for the education and advantage of the natives of this
kingdom, which hath produced men very eminent for learning and piety, and those of this
nation, and such there are in the Church: so that, while there are such, the passing them
by is not only, in some measure, a violation of the original intention and institution, but
a great discouragement to the natives from making themselves capable and fit for preferment
in the Church, whereunto, if they have equal parts, they are better able to do service than
strangers; their knowledge of the country and relations in it giving them the advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The promotion, too, of the already dignified or beneficed will make room for, and
consequently encourage, students in the University, which room will be lost, and the inferior
clergy much disheartened, if, upon the vacancy of bishopricks, persons unknown to the
kingdom and University shall be sent to fill them, and be less useful there to Church and
kingdom than those who are better acquainted with them.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The scandalous policy of setting
obscure and careless Englishmen to govern competent Irishmen, which reached its climax
under Primate Boulter’s influence, has now veered round so completely that there is an
outcry if an incompetent Irishman is not preferred to any Englishman, however competent.
Both extremes lead to the same mischief&mdash;estrangement in sentiment from England, and in
consequence narrow provincialism, which lowers the standard to be expected in important
posts, by selecting the best local man, instead of the best man in Great Britain and Ireland,
or even (for scientific appointments) in Europe.</p>

<p>But though the College was thus secured in ultimate material prosperity, there was for
some years great difficulty in realising property, and we find elections postponed for want of
funds in 1664 and 1666. A Fellow, William Leckey, was executed in Dublin for participation
in the plot of 1663 against the King. Still worse, we still find in what Jeremy Taylor
describes as “the little, but excellent University of Dublin,”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> great poverty in profound
scholarship. Two eminent men had indeed come out of Trinity College in this generation.
Dudley Loftus and Henry Dodwell were second to none of their contemporaries in learning.
Dodwell was offered a Chair at Oxford solely upon his general reputation. The catalogue of his
and Loftus’ extant works is still astonishing. Loftus combined in him the blood of the talented
adventurer Adam Loftus with the far sounder blood of the Usshers.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But these men would not
or could not be Provosts&mdash;so that high office fell to such men as Seele, the son of a verger at
Christ Church, esteemed highly by his contemporaries,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and Ward, who was of the old Loftus
type, having come over from England, and obtained five great promotions, ending with the See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of Derry, in which he died, at the age of 39! No wonder that clever lads sought their fortune
in Ireland. Ward “was esteemed a person of fine conversation and of great sagacity in
dextrously managing proper conjunctures, to which qualities his rise to so many preferments
in so short a time was ascribed.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It was a very great improvement, and of great service to the College, when the Duke of
Ormonde reverted again to Oxford, and brought over as Provost Narcissus Marsh, whose Library
at S. Sepulchre’s still attests the learning and wide interests of the man. Like every Provost
in those days, he was promptly advanced to the Episcopal Bench; the College then afforded a
stepping-stone to the episcopal as it now does to the judicial Bench; and if its rulers are now
usually very old, they were then very young. Marsh was only five years Provost before his
promotion, and yet even in that short time he produced a lasting effect upon the College.
What would such a man have accomplished in a lifetime of enlightened government! But
he was essentially a student, and the duties of the Provost were not then, as they now are,
compatible with a learned leisure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>January 167<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">8</span>
  <span class="blka over">9</span>
</span>.&mdash;Finding the place very troublesome, partly by reason of the multitude of business
and important visits the Provost is obliged to, and partly by reason of the ill education that the young
scholars have before they come to the College, whereby they are both rude and ignorant, I was quickly
weary of 340 young men and boys in this lewd, debauched town, and the more so because I had no
time to follow my dearly beloved studies.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
</div>

<p>I have already noted that this enterprising Englishman was bent on promoting the study
of the Irish language. Let me quote what Dr. Stubbs says&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Among the Smith MSS. in the Bodleian Library is preserved a letter<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> from Marsh when Primate,
in which he gives some account of the condition of the College during his residence as Provost. He was
particularly anxious, as he states, that the thirty Irish-born Scholars, who then enjoyed salaries equal to
those of the Junior Fellows, should be thoroughly trained to speak and write the Irish language. He
desired that these should be a body from which the parochial clergy of Ireland might be recruited, in order
that the people should have the ministrations of religion in their own language. The majority of the
Natives knew nothing of the grammar of the language, and could make no attempt to read it, or to
write it. In order to counteract this ignorance, Marsh determined that he would not elect to a native’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
place any scholar who was not ready to learn the Irish language thoroughly, and that he would not allow
them to retain their places unless they made satisfactory progress. To enable them to do this, he employed
a converted Roman Catholic priest, Paul Higgins, who was a good Irish scholar, and who had been
admitted as a clergyman of the Irish Church, to reside in his house, and to give instruction to the Scholars
of the College,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> at a salary of £16 a-year and his board. He had also the Church Service read in Irish,
and an Irish sermon preached by Higgins in the College Chapel on one Sunday afternoon in every month,
at 3 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> These services seem to have been open to the public; and we learn from Marsh’s letters that
the ancient Chapel was crowded by hearers on the occasion of the Irish sermons, the congregation
numbering as many as three hundred. We have no record of the continuance of these Irish services after
Marsh ceased to be Provost.”</p></div>

<p>He also promoted the study of mathematics, hitherto of little moment in the College. He
founded a Philosophical Society, as a sort of offshoot of the Royal Society of London, to which he
contributed a learned paper on Musical Sounds. The curious collection of ancient music still
extant in his Library (bequeathed for the use of the City of Dublin, but mainly intended for a
Diocesan Library) shows that he had a special interest in this subject. He wrote for the
students a sensible text-book of Logic (<em>see fac-simile of title-page, <a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a></em>). He got a new and
larger Chapel built, which lasted till 1798. But he was still in the era when the College
authorities had no idea of building ornamentally. The houses and halls were merely
modest constructions for use, and Dr. Campbell is quoted as describing them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Chapel is as mean a structure as you can conceive; destitute of monumental decoration within;
it is no better than a Welsh Church without. The old Hall, where College exercises are performed, is in
the same range, and built in the same style.&mdash;<em>Op. cit.</em> p. 117.</p></div>

<p>This is, I think, to be said of all the buildings in Dublin during the seventeenth century.
So far as I know, the earliest, and perhaps the best attempt at artistic architecture is the
Library, which was not commenced till 1709.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> All the handsome houses in Dublin date from
after the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>When Marsh was promoted&mdash;he became ultimately Archbishop of Dublin and then
Primate&mdash;Ormonde, the Chancellor, chose another Orientalist, Huntingdon of Merton College, to
succeed him. But he was by no means so able a man; he came over with great reluctance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(1686), and immediately decamped upon the outbreak of the second great tumult, which turned
out even worse for the College than 1641&mdash;the Revolution under James II., and the war which
was only concluded by William’s victory at the Boyne. The Revolution was a sore blow for the
College, which was now rapidly rising both in wealth and in intellectual position. The Senior
Fellows did all they could to conciliate James II., without, however, denying their own
Protestant character. The King, a weak man, gave them civil words; but they had to deal
with his advisers, who varied widely in their aims and hopes from those of moderate men.
The Acts passed by the brief Parliament of James II. have been recently brought into
clear light by historians,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and the only wonder to be explained is the escape of the College
from the secret Bill of Attainder which was to affect the liberties and properties of all
Protestants, and from which not even the power of the Crown could grant remission. The
anecdote how the members for the University kept out of the way, or sent the College
butler out of the way,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and managed to have the College names omitted, seems to be a
romance invented to explain an accidental omission, and to gain credit for some worthy
people who did not fly to England or betray their public trust.</p>

<p>The first acts of aggression were demands to appoint creatures of Tyrconnell’s either to an
Irish Lecturership which did not exist, or to Junior Fellowships, which required an oath of
allegiance to the Crown and of adherence to the Church of England, as ordered by Charles II. in
his <cite>Act of Uniformity</cite>. The Crown had been in the habit of appointing Fellows by mandamus,
so that this proceeding was not so high-handed as it would be now-a-days. But the plain
intention of James II.’s advisers, and especially of Tyrconnell, the Lord Deputy, was to force
Roman Catholics into power and to dispossess Protestant interests. It is to the credit of the
adventurers sent down to the College by Tyrconnell that they objected to take the oath. The
Lord Deputy then stopped the Concordatum Fund of £400 a-year. It was a moment when the
College so clearly felt its increasing numbers, that there was a proposal to sell some of the fast-accumulating
plate to find funds in aid of new buildings. Apart from gifts made by the parents
of pupils, there was a charge at matriculation for <em>argent</em>, as there still is in some Colleges at
Oxford, and it seems to have been thought a convenient way of laying by money which could be
easily realised in times of danger. How fast this plate had accumulated since the disasters of
1641 may be inferred from the fact that the College actually embarked 3,990 ounces of silver to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be sent to London (7th February, 1687). On the 12th, Tyrconnell was sworn in Lord Deputy,
and had the plate seized. The College reclaimed it, and ultimately recovered it on condition of
laying out the money in the purchase of land. It seems to have brought 5s. per ounce, and
is said to have been “profitably” invested. If the College now possessed it, the money value
would not be less than £5 per ounce; its value in adding dignity to the establishment is not
easily estimable. As Dr. Stubbs says, the succeeding events are best told from the College
Register, which he quotes:&mdash;</p>

</span>.&mdash;The College stock being very low, and there being little hopes of the coming in
of the rents, the following retrenchment of the College expenses was agreed upon by the Vice-Provost and
Senior Fellows.</p>

<p><em>January 24,</em>
168<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">8</span>
  <span class="blka over">9</span>
</span>.&mdash;The Visitors of the College did approve of the said retrenchment, which is as
follows:&mdash;Ordered by the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows, because the College is reduced to a low condition
by the infelicity of the times (no tenants paying any rents, and at present our stock being almost exhausted),
it was ordered that there should be a retrenchment of our expenses according to the model following; the
approbation of our Visitors being first obtained:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Inp.</em>&mdash;That there shall be but one meal a-day in the Hall, and that a dinner, because the supper is
the more expensive meal by reason of coals, &amp;c. 2. That every Fellow be allowed but three pence in the
Kitchen per diem, and one penny in the Buttery. 3. That the Scholars be allowed their full allowance
according to the Statutes, but after this manner, viz.:&mdash;To each Scholar in the Kitchen two pence per diem,
except on Friday, on which but three half pence. To each Scholar in the Buttery his usuall allowance, which
was one penny half penny per diem. To each Scholar at night shall be allowed out of the Buttery one half
penny in cheese or butter, except on Friday night, and that will compleat the Statute allowance. 4. That whereas
the Statute allowance to each Fellow in Buttery and Kitchen is five shillings and three pence per week, and
the present allowance comes but to two shillings and four pence, therefore it is ordered that whenever the
College is able, the first payments shall be made to the Fellows to compleat their Statute allowance in
Commons. All these clauses above mentioned are to be understood in relation to those that are resident.
And if it shall happen that the Society shall be forc’t to break up, and quit the place through extreme
necessity, or any publick calamity, that then all members of the said Society shall for the interim have full
title and claim to all profits and allowances in their severall stations and offices respectively, when it shall
please God to bring about a happy restoration. 5. That proportionable deductions be made from what was
formerly allow’d to the Cooks for decrements, furzes, &amp;c. 6. That the additional charge of Saturday’s
dinners be laid aside. 7. That for the future no Scholar of the House be allow’d Commons that is indebted
to his Tutor, and that no Master of Arts, Fellow Commoner, or Pensioner, be kept in Commons that has
not deposited sufficient caution money in the Bursar’s hands. 8. That whereas we are resolved to keep up
the Society as long as possibly we can, therefore ’tis ordered that as soon as the College money shall fail,
all the plate now in our custody be sold or pawned to defray the charges above mentioned. We, the Visitors
of the College above mentioned, having considered the expediency of the above retrenchment, do allow and
approve thereof.</p>

</span>.&mdash;It was agreed upon by the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows that the Manuscripts
in the Library, the Patents, and other writings belonging to the College, be transported into England. At
the same time it was resolved that the remainder of the plate should be immediately sold, excepting the
Chappel Plate. The same day the College waited on the Lord Deputy, and desired leave to transport the
remainder of their plate into England, because they could not sell it here without great loss.</p>

<p>The Lord Deputy refused leave.</p>

<p><em>February 19,</em>

</span>.&mdash;It was agreed on by the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows that two hundred
pounds of the College money should be sent into England for the support of those Fellows that should be
forc’t to fly thither. At the same time the dangers of staying in the College seemed so great that it was
judged reasonable that all those that thought fit to withdraw themselves from the College for their better
security might have free liberty so to do.</p>

</span>.&mdash;All the Horse, Foot, and Dragoons, were drawn out and posted at severall
places in the town, from whence they sent parties, who searcht the Protestant houses for arms, whilst others
were employed in breaking into stables and taking away all their horses. Two Companies of Foot, commanded
by Talbot, one of the Captains in the Royal Regiment of Foot Guards, came into the College,
searcht all places, and took away those few fusils, swords, and pistols, that they found. At the same time a
party of Dragoons broke open the College stables and took away all the horses. The Foot continued in the
College all night; the next day they were drawn off. On the same day it was agreed on by the Vice-Provost
and Senior Fellows that the Fellows and Scholars should receive out of the College trunk (the two hundred
pounds not being sent into England as was design’d) their salaries for their respective Fellowships, Offices, and
Scholarships, which will be due at the end of this current quarter, together with their allowance for Commons
for the said quarter.</p>

<p><em>March 12,</em>

</span>.&mdash;King James landed in Ireland; and upon the 24th of the same month, being
Palm Sunday, he came to Dublin. The College, with the Vice-Chancellor, waited upon him, and Mr. Thewles
made a speech, which he seemed to receive kindly, and promis’d ’em his favour and pretection;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> [but upon
the 16th of September, 1689, without any offence as much as pretended, the College was seized on for a
garrison by the King’s order, the Fellows turned out, and a Regiment of Foot took possession and continued
in it.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>]</p>

<p><em>June 13,</em> 1689.&mdash;Mr. Arthur Greene having petitioned the King for a Senior Fellowship, the case
was refer’d to Sir Richard Nagle; upon which he sent an order to the Vice-Provost and Fellows to meet him
at his house on Monday, the 17th, to shew reason why the aforesaid petition shud not be granted. The
reasons offer’d were many, part of ’em drawn from false allegations in the petition, part from the petitioner’s
incapacity in several respects to execute the duty of a Senior Fellow; and the conclusion was in these words:
There are much more important reasons drawn, as well from the Statutes relating to religion, as from the
obligation of oaths which we have taken, and the interests of our religion, which we will never desert, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
render it wholly impossible, without violating our consciences, to have any concurrence, or to be any way concerned,
in the admission of him.</p>

<p><em>July 24.</em>&mdash;The Vice-Provost and Fellows, with consent of the Vice-Chancellor, sold a peece of plate
weighing about 30 ounces for subsistence of themselves and the Scholars that remained.</p>

<p><em>September 6.</em>&mdash;The College was seized on for a Garrison by the King’s order, and Sir John Fitzgerald
took possession of it. Upon Wednesday the 11th, it was made a prison for the Protestants of the City, of
whom a great number were confined to the upper part of the Hall. Upon the 16th the Scholars were all
turned out by souldiers, and ordered to carry nothing with ’em but their books. But Mr. Thewles and some
others were not permitted to take their books with ’em. Lenan, one of the Scholars of the House, was sick
of the small-pox, and died, as it was supposed, by removing. At the same time the King sent an order to
apprehend six of the Fellows and Masters, and commit ’em to the main guard, and all this without any provocation
or crime as much as pretended; but the Bishop of Meath, our Vice-Chancellor, interceded with the
King, and procured the last order to be stopt.</p>

<p><em>September 28.</em>&mdash;The Chappel-plate and the Mace were seized on and taken away. The plate was sent
to the Custom-house by Colonel Lutterel’s order; but it was preserved by Mr. Collins, one of the Commissioners
of the Revenue.</p>

<p><em>October 21.</em>&mdash;Several persons, by order of the Government, seized upon the Chappel and broke open
the Library. The Chappel was sprinkled and new consecrated and Mass was said in it; but afterwards being
turned into a storehouse for powder, it escaped all further damage. The Library and Gardens and the Provost’s
lodgings were committed to the care of one Macarty, a Priest and Chaplain to ye King, who preserved ’em
from the violence of the souldiers, but the Chambers and all other things belonging to ye College were
miserably defaced and ruined.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>We find in the <cite>Dublin Magazine</cite> for August, 1762, p. 54, the following petition of the Roman Catholic
Prelates of Ireland, which was probably presented to James II. at this time:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Humbly Sheweth</span></p>

<p><span class="pad8">“That</span> the Royal College of Dublin is the only University of this Kingdom, and
now wholly at your Majesty’s disposal, the teachers and scholars having deserted it.</p>

<p>“That before the Reformation it was common to all the natives of this country, as the other most
famous Universities of Europe to theirs, respectively, and the ablest Scholars of this Nation preferred to be
professors and teachers therein, without any distinction of orders, congregations, or politic bodies, other than
that of true merit, as the competent judges of learning and piety, after a careful and just scrutiny did approve.</p>

<p>“That your petitioners being bred in foreign Colleges and Universities, and acquainted with many of
this Nation, who in the said Universities purchased the credit and renown of very able men in learning, do
humbly conceive themselves to be qualified for being competent and proper judges of the fittest to be
impartially presented to your Majesty, and employed as such directors and teachers (whether secular or
regular clergymen) as may best deserve it, which as is the practice of other Catholic Universities, so it will
undoubtedly prove a great encouragement to learning, and very advantageous to this Nation, entirely devoted
to your Majesty’s interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your petitioners therefore do most humbly pray that your Majesty may be graciously pleased to let
your Irish Catholic subjects make use of the said College for the instruction of their youth, and that it may
be a general Seminary for the clergy of this Kingdom, and that either all the bishops, or such of them as
your Majesty will think fit (by your Royal authority and commission), present the most deserving persons to
be directors and teachers in the said College, and to oversee it, to the end it may be well ruled and truly
governed, and pure orthodox doctrine, piety and virtue be taught and practised therein, to the honour and
glory of God, propagation of his true religion, and general good of your Majesty’s subjects in this realm, and
as in duty bound they will ever pray,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>And the following petition from the heads of the College appears upon the Register:&mdash;</p>

upon the 28th of the said month, under pretence for a search for arms, seizure was made by one Hogan of
the Sacred Chalices and other holy vessels belonging to ye Altar of the Chappel, and also of the Mace; that

<p><em>June 14,</em> 1690.&mdash;King William landed at Carrick Fergus, and the same day Mr. Thewles died of a
fever.</p>

<p><em>July 1,</em> 1690.&mdash;The armies of the English and Irish engaged at the Boyne, and the Irish being routed,
King James returned that night to Dublin, and commanded his army not to plunder or do any harm to the
city, which order was observed by ye Irish.</p>

<p><em>July 15,</em> 1690.&mdash;Mr. Scroggs landed, and immediately after Dr. Browne, and then Mr. Downes, Mr.
Reader, the Provost, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The Fellows and Scholars that returned were allowed their Commons, but their salary was reduced
by agreement to the old Statute allowance, both for Fellowships and places, till the College revenues shall
increase.</p>

<p>Before King William left Ireland he gave order to ye College to seize upon all books that belonged
to forfeiting Papists; but the order not being known till about half a-year after, the greatest part of the books
were lost, but those which were recovered, and worth anything, were placed in the Countess of Bath’s library.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></div>

<p>The interesting features in this crisis were, first, the steadfast and courageous behaviour
of Dr. Acton and his three colleagues, two of whom sacrificed their lives for the good of the
College; secondly, the excellent conduct of the two Roman Catholic priests, Moore and
Macarthy, who not only exerted themselves with great humanity to save the Fellows and
scholars and their property from outrage, but showed a real love and respect for learning, and
a desire to maintain the College for the real objects of its foundation.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Thus, if it had not
been for the narrowness of controversialists and the violence of soldiers, the assaults of Rome
and Geneva were by no means so disastrous as might have been expected. Nevertheless,
the College came out of the crisis of James II. with great loss of books, furniture, plate,
rents&mdash;in fact, for the moment in great distress&mdash;but still the buildings were safe;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the
character of the College must have been greatly raised by the conduct of its Fellows; there
had been no time to occupy the estates with new adventurers; and the policy of the new King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in spite of his well-known Liberal instincts, must necessarily be strongly Protestant after the
recent outburst of the opposite party under his opponent, and therefore made him a firm
friend of the persecuted College.</p>

CHAPEL PLATE. (DATED 1632 AND 1638).</div>
</div>

<p>Before closing this chapter, we may say a word upon the changing aspect of the College
and its surroundings, especially College Green. The foundation of the College soon brought
with it a desire to build houses in its neighbourhood. But in Bedell’s diary we find that
the first permission given by the Corporation to build houses close to the gate was frustrated
by the students raiding upon the works, and carrying the building-plant into the College. The
builder, indeed, recovered it by the interference of the Provost, but whether the building
proceeded is doubtful. Still, we hear of Archbishop Ussher lodging in College Green in 1632, a
very few years after; and a lodging fit for the Primate can have been no mean dwelling.
There were several sites granted on the north side of Dame Street by the Corporation to
gentlemen of quality, who built houses, with gardens stretching behind them to the river.
I have found mention of three of these before 1640. Presently two larger mansions were erected
there&mdash;Clancarty House, at the foot of the present S. Andrew’s Street, and opposite it Chichester
House, always a large mansion, often used for Courts, and even Parliaments, till the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
remarkable building was set upon its site. It was one of the objections urged in 1668 to
Trinity Hall (the site of the present S. Andrew’s Church) for holding students, that they
could not hear the College bell owing to the number of intervening houses. Thus Dublin
must have been rapidly growing out in this direction.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> There are houses in Dawson Street and
Molesworth Street whose gables show them to belong to the 17th century. So likewise in
the streets off South Great George’s Street there are still many houses which bear the clear
character of Dublin building from 1660 to 1700. All the churches were remodelled or rebuilt in
the end of this or in the succeeding century. But, as I have already said, there was as yet no
thought of stately or ornamental house architecture. The existing blocks of that date in Trinity
College (Nos. 22-31) show what was accomplished, and though far better than the buildings
of “Botany Bay,” which came a century later, are nevertheless mainly interesting from their date
as marking an epoch in this History. There is no hint that the other lodgings for students,
since taken down, were in any sense ornamental.</p>

<p>I turn, in concluding this chapter, to the interesting question of the recognition of sports
and games among the students&mdash;a recognition which reached its climax under Provost
Hutchinson. The following passage gives us some facts and dates:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There does not appear to have been any arrangement for the recreation of the Students inside the
College until 1684, when we find the following entry on August 13:&mdash;“The ground for the Bowling-green
was granted, and the last Commencement supper fees were allowed towards the making of it.” The
bowling-green, which was near the present gymnasium and racquet-court, and probably on the site of the
existing [lawn] tennis-courts, was maintained until early in this century, and a portion of the entrance fees of
Fellow Commoners was applied to maintain it. On July 28, 1694, leave was given to build a fives-court at
the east end of the Fellows’ garden. In Brooking’s map of Dublin there appears to have been, in 1728, a
quadrangular walled-in court on the site of the present New Square, for the recreation of the Students.
There were two gates giving access to this in the arches under numbers 23 and 25 in the Library Square,
which is the oldest existing part of the College, and which was erected after [about] 1700. As the Students
were prohibited from going out into the city without leave, it was obviously necessary that opportunities
should be given for out-door amusements within the bounds; and the College Park had not been at this
time laid out and planted. A number of small paddocks occupied at this period the site of the present
Park; and the College Park, as we have it now, was first formed and planted with trees in 1722.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Some comment upon this passage seems desirable. In the Elizabethan and Jacobean
College recreations for the students were not only ignored but forbidden. Young men
came there and were maintained at the expense of the Institution, not to play, but to
work, as I have above explained. This strictly theological notion was now giving way to
a secular aspect of things, which tolerated the residence of students in the city,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and received
wealthy young men, who came to spend, not to earn money. The facts just quoted are
therefore interesting in showing that this change of spirit was now accomplished. For in
colleges outward acts follow slowly upon new convictions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> At the moment that Sir William Brereton visited Dublin (July, 1635), the College and Church of the Jesuits in
Back Lane, with its carved pulpit and high altar, had lately (1633) been annexed to Trinity College, and lectures were held
there every Tuesday, Lord Corke paying for the Lecturer. Brereton also saw a cloister and Chapel of the Capuchins,
which had been turned into S. Stephen’s Hall, in which 18 scholars of the College were then accommodated. It is
remarkable that all attempts, whether promoted by the College or not, to shape the University of Trinity College according
to the peculiar model of Oxford and Cambridge have failed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> It is, indeed, rehearsed with great care in these Statutes that they are approved of by the Provost and Fellows,
and imposed with their consent; but that consent was extorted by interfering with the appointment of Provost, and
choosing Chappel to carry out the new policy.</p></div>

of his pressing his adversary in a public disputation at Cambridge so keenly that the unfortunate man swooned in the
pulpit, when King James, who was present, took up the argument, and presently confessed himself worsted. This kind of
subtlety may have enabled him to reconcile his various breaches of statute with his sworn obligations. His holding of
the Bishopric and Provostship together was, however, openly sanctioned by Laud. His Latin autobiography gives us a
picture quite inconsistent with the complaints of the Fellows and the resolutions of the Irish Parliament against him. It is
a string of pious lamentations, <em>e.g.</em>&mdash;</p>

educated first in France, then at Cambridge, and then appointed a Fellow of the College, by competition, in 1610. Thus he
added to his Irish blood and knowledge of the country a wide and various experience. But the terrible insurrection which swept
over the land made these qualities of little import beside his moral strength. When driven from his Diocese of Meath, he was
made temporary Provost, according to the petition of the Fellows, who found fault with Faithful Tate (Stubbs, appendix).
He suffered further persecution from the Parliamentary Commissioners, but through all his adversities maintained the same
constancy. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Is est qualis alii tantum videri volunt, et in humaniori literatura, et in vitæ integritate germanissimus, certe

<p class="drop-capx">The great expansion of the College about the time of its first Centenary
seems to have been rather the effect of circumstances than of a strong
and able government. The Provosts were perpetually being promoted
to Bishoprics, and were in any case not very remarkable men. Nevertheless,
the Centenary was celebrated with great pomp, and in a manner
widely different from that which is now in fashion at such feasts. Almost the
whole day was occupied with various orations in praise of founders or of the
studies of the place. We do not hear that any visitors but the local grandees of
Dublin attended, nor is there any detail concerning the entertainment of the body,
after the weariness inflicted upon the mind, of the audience. There may possibly be some
details still concealed in the College Register, the publication of which among our historical
records is earnestly to be desired. Dr. Stubbs (pp. 136-8) prints the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the morning there were the customary prayers in the Chapel and a sermon.</p>

<p>At 2 p.m., after a musical instrumental performance, an oration was made by Peter Browne,
F.T.C., containing a panegyric in honour of Queen Elizabeth: “Deus nobis hæc otia fecit.” Dominus
Maude, Fellow Commoner, followed with a Carmen Seculare in Latin hexameters&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verseq">“Aspice venturo lætentur ut omnia seclo</p>
<p class="verse0">... sequitur ramis insignis olivæ.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Then Benjamin Pratt, F.T.C., followed with praise of King James the First: “Munificentissimi Academiæ
auctoris;” “pariter pietate vel armis egregii.”</p>

<p>George Carr, F.T.C., commemorated the Chancellors of the University during the preceding century&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“Nec nos iterum meminisse pigebit Elissæ.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Richard Gethinge, Bart., followed with an English poem in memory of the illustrious founder
of the College.</p>

<p>Robert Mossom, F.T.C., delivered a Latin oration in praise of Charles the First and Charles the
Second&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Heu pietas, heu prisca fides ...</p>
<p class="verse0">... Amavit nos quoque Daphnis.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Then followed a recitation of some pastoral verses by Dr. Tighe and Dr. Denny, Fellow Commoners, bearing
upon the revival of the University by William and Mary&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>A thanksgiving ode was then sung, accompanied by instrumental music.</p>

<p>A grateful commemoration of the benefits which the City of Dublin had conferred upon the
University, by Richard Baldwin, F.T.C.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“Laudabunt alii claram Rhodon aut Mitylenen.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Verses commemorating the hospitality shown to the members of the University when dispersed, by
the sister Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, were recited by Benjamin Hawkshaw, B.A., William
Tisdall, B.A., Jeremiah Harrison, B.A.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“ ... Quales decet esse Sorores.”</p>

<p>Then there was a Latin debate on the subject, “Whether the Sciences and Arts are more indebted

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p>To this Dunton, writing from Dublin in 1699, while the memory of it was still fresh, adds
some curious details&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Leaving Dr. Phœnix’s house, our next visit was to the College of Dublin, where several worthy gentlemen
(both Fellows and others) had been great benefactors to my auction. When we came to the College,
we went first to my friend Mr. Young’s chamber; but he not being at home we went to see the Library,
which is over the Scholars’ lodgings, the length of one of the quadrangles, and contains a great many choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
books of great value, particularly one, the largest I ever saw for breadth; it was an “Herbal,” containing the
lively portraitures of all sorts of trees, plants, herbs, and flowers. By this “Herbal” lay a small book, containing
about sixty pages in a sheet, to make it look like “the Giant and the Dwarf.” There also (since I
have mentioned a giant) we saw lying on a table the thigh-bone of a giant, or at least of some monstrous
overgrown man, for the thigh-bone was as long as my leg and thigh; which is kept there as a convincing
demonstration of the vast bigness which some human bodies have in former times arrived to. We were next
showed by Mr. Griffith, a Master of Arts (for he it was that showed us these curiosities), the skin of one Ridley,
a notorious Tory, which had been long ago executed; he had been begged for an anatomy, and, being
flayed, his skin was tanned, and stuffed with straw. In this passive state he was assaulted with some mice
and rats, not sneakingly behind his back, but boldly before his face, which they so much further mortified,
even after death, as to eat it up; which loss has since been supplied by tanning the face of one Geoghagan,
a Popish Priest, executed about six years ago for stealing; which said face is put in the place of Ridley’s.</p>

<p>At the east end of this Library, on the right hand, is a chamber called “The Countess of Bath’s
Library,” filled with many handsome folios, and other books, in Dutch binding, gilt, with the Earl’s Arms
impressed upon them; for he had been some time of this house.</p>

<p>On the left hand, opposite to this room, is another chamber, in which I saw a great many manuscripts,
medals, and other curiosities. At the west end of the Library there is a division made by a kind of wooden
lattice-work, containing about thirty paces, full of choice and curious books, which was the Library of that
great man, Archbishop Ussher, Primate of Armagh, whose learning and exemplary piety has justly made him
the ornament, not only of that College (of which he was the first scholar that ever was entered in it, and the
first who took degrees), but of the whole Hibernian nation.</p>

<p>At the upper end of this part of the Library hangs at full length the picture of Dr. Chaloner,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> who
was the first Provost of the College, and a person eminent for learning and virtue. His picture is likewise
at the entrance into the Library, and his body lies in a stately tomb made of alabaster. At the west end of
the Chapel, near Dr. Chaloner’s picture (if I do not mistake), hangs a new skeleton of a man, made up and
given by Dr. Gwither, a physician of careful and happy practice, of great integrity, learning, and sound
judgment, as may be seen by those treatises of his that are inserted in some late “Philosophical Transactions.”</p>

<p>Thus, Madam, have I given you a brief account of the Library, which at present is but an ordinary
pile of building, and cannot be distinguished on the outside; but I hear they design the building of a new
Library, and, I am told, the House of Commons in Ireland have voted £3,000 towards carrying it on.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>After having seen the Library, we went to visit Mr. Minshull, whose father I knew in Chester. Mr.
Minshull has been student in the College for some time, and is a very sober, ingenious youth, and I do
think is descended from one of the most courteous men in Europe; I mean Mr. John Minshull, bookseller
in Chester.</p>

<p>After a short stay in this gentleman’s chamber, we were led by one Theophilus, a good-natured sensible
fellow, to see the new house now building for the Provost, which, when finished, will be very noble and
magnificent.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> After this, Theophilus showed us the gardens belonging to the College, which were very pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and entertaining. Here was a sun-dial, on which might be seen what o’clock it was in most parts of the
world.</p>

<p>This dial was placed upon the top of a stone representing a pile of books; and not far from this
was another sun-dial, set in box, of very large compass, the gnomon of it being very near as big as a barber’s
pole.</p>

<p>Leaving this pleasant garden, we ascended several steps, which brought us into a curious walk, where
we had a prospect to the west of the city and to the east of the sea and harbour; on the south we could
see the mountains of Wicklow, and on the north the River Liffey, which runs by the side of the College.</p>

<p>Having now, and at other times, thoroughly surveyed the College, I shall here attempt to give your
Ladyship a very particular account of it. It is called Trinity College, and is the sole University of Ireland. It
consists of three squares, the outward being as large as both the inner, one of which, of modern building, has
not chambers on every side; the other has, on the south side of which stands the Library, the whole length of
the square. I shall say nothing of the Library here (having already said something of it), so I proceed to tell
you, Madam, that the Hall and Butteries run the same range with the Library, and separate the two inner
squares. It is an old building, as is also the Regent-house, which from a gallery looks into the Chapel, which
has been of late years enlarged, being before too little for the number of Scholars, which are now, with the
Fellows, &amp;c., reckoned about 340. They have a garden for the Fellows, and another for the Provost, both neatly
kept, as also a bowling green, and large parks for the students to walk and exercise in. The Foundation
consists of a Provost (who at present is the Reverend Dr. George Brown, a gentleman bred in this house
since a youth, when he was first entered, and one in whom they all count themselves very happy, for he is an
excellent governor, and a person of great piety, learning, and moderation), seven Senior Fellows, of whom two
are Doctors in Divinity, eight Juniors, to which one is lately added, and seventy Scholars. Their Public
Commencements are at Shrovetide, and the first Tuesday after the eighth of July. Their Chancellor is His
Grace the Duke of Ormonde. Since the death of the Right Reverend the Bishop of Meath<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> they have had
no Vice-Chancellor, only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro re nata</i>.</p>

<p>The University was founded by Queen Elizabeth, and by her and her successors largely endowed,
and many munificent gifts and legacies since made by several other well-disposed persons, all whose names,
together with their gifts, are read publicly in the Chapel every Trinity Sunday, in the afternoon, as a grateful
acknowledgment to the memory of their benefactors; and on the 9th of January, 1693 (which completed a
century from the Foundation of the College), they celebrated their first secular day, when the Provost, Dr.
Ashe, now Bishop of Clogher, preached, and made a notable entertainment for the Lords Justices, Privy
Council, Lord Mayor and Aldermen of Dublin. The sermon preached by the Provost was on the subject of
the Foundation of the College, and his text was Matthew xxvi. 13: “Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this
Gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a
memorial of her;” which in this sermon the Provost applied to Queen Elizabeth, the Foundress of the College.
The sermon was learned and ingenious, and afterwards printed by Mr. Ray, and dedicated to the Lords
Justices, who at that time were the Lord Henry Capel, Sir Cyril Wiche, and William Duncomb, Esq. In
the afternoon there were several orations in Latin spoke by the scholars in praise of Queen Elizabeth and
the succeeding Princes, and an ode made by Mr. Tate (the Poet Laureate), who was bred up in this College.
Part of the ode was as this following:&mdash;</p>

<p>After this ode had been sung by the principal gentlemen of the Kingdom, there was a very diverting
speech made in English by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ Filius</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The night concluded with illuminations, not only in the College
but in other places. Madam, this day being to be observed but once in a hundred years, was the reason
why I troubled your ladyship with this account.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The sermon preached by Dr. St.-G. Ashe, who presently resigned the Provostship, is still
extant;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> so is the musical ode, but so scarce that there seems to be only one copy known,
which the researches for the present feast have unearthed. Some of the text, which
was composed by Nahum Tate, sometime (1672) a scholar of the House, is given above
from Dunton; the rest, which is printed with the music, is of the same quality. It is
chiefly a panegyric of the reigning sovereigns, William and Mary, justified by their recent
indulgences to the College on account of its losses in the Revolution. The music of
the ode was composed by no less a person than Henry Purcell, and would certainly have
been repeated at our Tercentenary had it been equal to his standard works. But it is a
curiously poor and perfunctory piece of work, whereas the anthem then recently composed
by Blow, “I beheld, and lo, a great multitude,” still holds its place in our Chapel, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
gladly reproduce it in the present festival. The title-page of the score of the ode states that
it was performed at Christ Church, whereas the accounts of the celebration speak of it in the
College&mdash;a discrepancy which I cannot reconcile.</p>

Being the First SECULAR DAY SINCE ITS FOUNDATION BY Queen ELIZABETH<br />
<br />

Printed by <em>Joseph Ray</em> on <em>College Green</em>, for <em>William Norman</em><br />

</div>

<p>The series of Provosts to whom I have referred&mdash;Ashe (1692), G. Browne (1695),
Peter Browne (1699), Pratt (1710)&mdash;were all promoted to Bishoprics, except the first
Browne, who died of the blow of a brickbat which struck him in a College row, and
Pratt, who was so insignificant that he could only obtain a Deanery as a bribe for
his resignation. Of these but one man has left a name, Peter Browne<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who composed
a work on the “Procedure of the Understanding,” evidently called forth by the recent
Essay of Locke, which had been introduced into the post-graduate course by Ashe, and
was then very popular. More celebrated, and more interesting in this history, is the
well-known Charge to the clergy of Cork <em>on drinking healths</em>, in which the Bishop criticises
“the glorious, pious, and immortal memory” so dear to Irish Protestants, and all such other
toasts, as senseless, heathenish, and offensive. It was always understood by his contemporaries
that this Charge showed the writer to be a Jacobite, and when we hear of the long
struggle of Provost Baldwin in subduing this spirit in the College, we may fairly conjecture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that during the reign of Browne (1699-1710) it was allowed to grow without active
interference. It may indeed be thought that the declaration of loyalty to Queen Anne,
drawn up and signed by the Senate in 1708 (Stubbs, Appendix xxxiv.), where Peter Browne’s
name as Provost appears next to the Vice-Chancellor’s, is evidence against this statement. The
declaration was caused by the speech of one Edward Forbes, who was deprived of his degrees.
I do not, however, think this merely formal declaration can overcome the indirect, but serious
evidence of the Bishop’s personal Charge. There seem to be very few details published
concerning this remarkable man’s life. But a group of famous young men were then passing
through the College&mdash;Swift, Berkeley, Delany; and King, an old scholar, was Archbishop of
Dublin. Berkeley was a Fellow, but we hear nothing of him in the College politics of the
day.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The Foundation, therefore, had now become strong enough to live and flourish in spite
of, or in disregard of, its governors. There is now, indeed, much insubordination mentioned.
There seem to have been many disturbances; the discipline of the place had doubtless
suffered through constantly changing Provosts, who were probably counting upon promotion
as soon as they were appointed. It was therefore of no small importance to the ultimate
success of Trinity College, that for almost the whole of the eighteenth century it was
ruled by three men who were not promoted, and who devoted a life’s interest to their
duties. In the forty years preceding 1717 there had been (counting Moore) eight Provosts.
In the eighty years succeeding there were only three, and of these the first, Baldwin, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
probably the guiding spirit during the rule of his weak predecessor, since 1710. The
reasons which prevented Baldwin going the way of all Provosts in those days, and
passing on to a Bishopric, have never been explained. His contemporaries were more
surprised at it (says Taylor) than we can be. And yet these reasons are manifest
enough, and disclosed to us in one of the most obvious sources of information&mdash;the
private correspondence of Primate Boulter. That narrow and mischievous Whig politician,
whose whole correspondence is one vast network of jobbing in appointments,
came into power in 1724, and was for eighteen years the arbiter of promotion, even
of lay promotion, in Ireland. He was a man so tenacious of a few ideas, that he keeps
repeating them in the same form with a persistency quite ludicrous, if it had not led
to very mischievous effects. He shows the same earnestness, whether it be in
importuning Bishops and Ministers for the promotion to a Canonry of an obscure
friend whose eyesight was so defective that he was unfit for any post; or whether it be
in urging his narrow policy that all the high offices in Ireland should be filled by
Englishmen. “I hope, after what I have written in many letters before, I need not
again urge the necessity of the See not being filled with a native of the country.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> And
it is remarkable that by <em>natives</em> he only means the Anglo-Irish who had now attained
like Swift, some feeling for the rights of Ireland. Hence he shows in many letters a
marked dislike and suspicion of Trinity College, which asserted its independence against
him. This nettled his officious and meddling temper considerably. “I cannot help
saying it would have been for the King’s service here if what has lately been transacting in
relation to the Professors had been concerted with some of the English here, and not wholly
with the natives, and that after a secret manner; that the College might have thought it
their interest to have some dependence on the English” (i., 227). Swift and Delany he
accordingly disliked exceedingly, and so persistent was his hostility to the Fellows, whom he
calls a nest of Jacobites, that he kept hindering their promotion to the Bench during the whole
of his unfortunate reign&mdash;for such we may call it&mdash;over Ireland. Twice he touches upon the
claims of Baldwin, whom he confesses to be a strong Whig politician; he speaks of him
with coldness. He mentions with alarm the rumour that the Provost is to be promoted,
because he regards it impossible to find a safe man to succeed him in the College. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
clearly urges this difficulty as a reason against his promotion. In another place&mdash;which has
been called a recommendation of Baldwin&mdash;he uses the following words:&mdash;“Since my return
the Bishop of Ossory is dead, and we [the Lords Justices] have this day joined in a letter
to your Grace, mentioning the most proper persons here to be promoted to that See. But I
must beg leave to assure your Grace that I think it is of great importance to the English
interest that some worthy person should be sent us from England to fill this vacancy. <em>If
any person here should be thought of</em>, I take the promotion most for the King’s service here
will be the making Dr. Baldwin Bishop, and Dr. Gilbert Provost.” To this letter he
receives a reply in ten days, to which he answers in his next&mdash;“I am glad to hear of the
promotion of Dr. Edward Tenison to the See of Ossory, and thank your Grace for the news.”</p>

<p>So successful, indeed, was this malefactor to the College in impressing his policy upon
English ministers, that while the years 1703-20 had seen six future Bishops and three future
Deans obtain Fellowships, from 1721 to 1763 but one Fellow was elected, Hugh Hamilton,
who obtained either honour. The non-promotion of Baldwin was therefore a mere instance
of Boulter’s policy, which prevailed for half-a-century. But the accident of this injustice was
of great indirect benefit to the College. Instead of many Bishoprics, we obtained our first
permanent Provost.</p>

<p>The greatest luminary in the united Church of England and Ireland at the time was
the modest and pious George Berkeley. How does Boulter accept his promotion, which he
could not prevent? “As to a successor to the Bishop of Cloyne, my Lord Lieutenant
looks upon it as settled in England that Dean Berkeley is to be made Bishop here on the
first occasion. I have therefore nothing more to say on that point, but that <em>I wish the
Dean’s promotion may answer the expectation of his friends in England</em>!”</p>

<p>The next two Provosts were laymen and politicians, to whom promotion did not bar the
retention of the Collegiate office. When the last of these three men passed away, the
government of the College again lapsed into the hands of a series of Bishops-expectant,
succeeding one another with monotonous obscurity, till the advent of Bartholomew Lloyd in
1837 marks a new epoch, almost in modern times. The eighteenth century, therefore,
stands out with great distinctness in this history. Almost all the buildings of the College
that give it dignity date from this time. A new conception of what the country owed to
the University, and the University promised to fulfil, entered into men’s minds. Grants of
hundreds now became grants of thousands; salaries were no longer pittances but prizes;
the Fellows of the College became dignitaries, not only on account of their position, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
their wealth; and the much-tried and long-struggling College at length attained security,
respect, and influence throughout the country. The external appearance of the buildings
changed as completely as the spirit of the students. The College in 1770 was far more
like that of 1892 than that of 1700.</p>

<p>The first of these three Provosts, Baldwin, had probably more influence on the history
of the College than any one since the founders. He was either a self-made man, or put
forward by some influence which disguised itself, so that many varying traditions were
current about his origin and youth. Taylor, who gives very explicitly the authorities for his
story, tells us (p. 249) that Baldwin, being at school at Colne, in Lancashire, where he was born
in 1672, killed one of his schoolfellows with a blow, and so fled to Ireland. On arriving
in Dublin, being then twelve years of age, he was found crying in the streets, when a
person who kept a coffee-house took pity on him, and brought him to his home, where
he remained for some time in the capacity of a waiter. A few months after, Provost
Huntingdon wanted a boy to take care of his horse, when Richard Baldwin was recommended
to him, and the Provost had him instructed and entered at the College. Dr.
Stubbs ignores this story altogether, apparently on the ground of the (not inconsistent)
entry in Kilkenny College, that a boy of this name matriculated from that place in April,
1685; the College admission book, however, gives the date April, 1684; indeed, most of the
dates of his earlier promotions appear inaccurate, for though he may have been a scholar
in 1686, how can he have been a B.A. in 1689, when he is known to have fled to England,
and to have supported himself by teaching in a school in Chester? Dr. Barrett’s statements
are evidently only hearsay. It is certain that grants of money were given to him as a
refugee in England in 1688. At all events, he was made a Fellow in 1693, and a Senior
Fellow in 1697, from which time he either helped in governing, or governed the College,
till his death in 1758. He was Vice-Provost, under a lazy absentee Provost, from 1710;
he was appointed Provost in 1717.</p>

<p>Baldwin appears to have been in no sense a literary man, beyond what was necessary
for his examinations; on the other hand, he was a strong and consistent Whig politician, a
disciplinarian, and evidently very keen about the architectural improvement of the College.
He accumulated a large fortune, which he left to endow it, and which various claimants of
his name from England strove to appropriate for seventy years. In spite of all these merits
towards the College, he is not remembered with affection. The extant portraits of him
represent a stupid and expressionless face, suggesting severity without natural dignity or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
good breeding, though he became so great a figure in the College from the mere duration of
his influence. He did little to improve the intellectual condition of the students. His
temper was morose, and his policy of crushing out not only political, but other opposition
among both students and Fellows made him for a long time very unpopular. It is
more than likely that his tyrannical conduct in politics increased rather than diminished the
Jacobite spirit in the College, for the recalcitrant tendencies of youth were then as they now
are, and neither Queen Anne nor George I. was ever likely to inspire the Irish students
with any enthusiastic loyalty.</p>

<p>But Baldwin may fairly be called the architect of the College. I do not include under
that expression his vigilant supervision and enhancement of the College rents&mdash;a very important
duty,&mdash;or his large bequests to the society, which have made the office of Provost one of
wealth as well as of dignity. His claim to be remembered by the Irish public rests upon
more obvious grounds. The undertaking of the present Library building coincides with his
advent to power. It was actually commenced when, as Vice-Provost, he ruled for the easy-going
Pratt. It was finished in the early and stormy years of his Provostship; and when
we consider that of all the buildings which give Dublin the air and style of a capital not
one then existed, we may better understand the largeness and boldness of the plan. The
Royal Hospital at Kilmainham had indeed been recently erected, as the arms of the second
Duke of Ormonde over the main door testify. This building, which a vague and probably
false tradition in Dublin attributes to Wren, must have produced no small impression by its
splendour. It was planned exactly as a college, with the hall and chapel <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in directum</i>,
forming one side of a quadrangle, and surmounted by a belfry. Such is the plan of many
colleges at Oxford. And such was still the plan of Chapel and Hall in Trinity College when
the eighteenth century opened, and when larger ideas suggested themselves with the increase
of wealth and the disappearance of danger from war or tumult. Building had never ceased
in the College since the Act of Settlement secured the great College estates in the North
and West. Seele had worked hard to restore and enlarge the buildings, dilapidated through
age and poverty; Marsh and Huntingdon had built a new Chapel and Hall on the site of
the present Campanile, but excessively plain and ugly; even Pratt proposed the building of
a new belfry over the Hall, a plan which was carried out thirty years after his resignation.
The Chapel is compared by a visitor to a Welsh church. The old tower at the north side
of the College, which had lasted from the days of All Hallowes’ Abbey, was restored by
Seele, who evidently strove to save this relic of the past. The Front Square was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rebuilt, when the dangerous interlude of James II.’s occupation beggared the College for a
moment, after which the houses of the Library Square, which still stand there, were taken in
hand. Perfectly plain they were, but solid, and have stood the wear and tear of nearly 200
years, not to speak of the improving fury of occasional innovators, who, even in our day,
have threatened them with destruction.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> They have been disfigured, as the Royal Hospital
has been, with ugly grey plaster. If the original red bricks were uncovered, and a tile roof
set upon them, the public would presently find out that they were picturesque. At all
events, the west side, which was taken down in this century, was a better and more suitable
building than those erected (“Botany Bay”) by way of compensation.</p>

<p>The bold undertaking of building the present great Library, without possessing books
enough to fill more than a corner of it, must have been Baldwin’s idea. It was no doubt
he who hit upon the idea of soliciting the Irish Parliament for grants, although the College
was rapidly increasing in wealth. £15,000 was obtained in this way between 1712 and
1724, when the building was finished. The total cost is said to have been only £17,000!
Dr. Stubbs deserves the credit of discovering the name of the architect, which was long
forgotten, and which is not mentioned, I believe, in the College Register. He was Mr.
Thomas Burgh, in charge of the fortifications of King William III. If the Royal Barracks,
lately abandoned, were also his work, they offer a strange contrast to his plan for the
Library. What his old Custom House in Essex Street was like I do not know.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Neither do I
know upon what authority Dr. Stubbs adds another detail, that the two small staircases
inside the west door, which lead to the gallery, were transferred from the older library, where
Bishop Jones had set them up in 1651. If so, these staircases are the oldest piece of
woodwork in the College, unless it be the pulpit used for grace in the present Dining Hall,
which bears evidences of being equally old. The further history of this Library, which was
rapidly enriched by many valuable bequests, forms the subject of another chapter.</p>

<p>The next improvement seems to have been the laying out and planting of the College
Park, beyond a closed quadrangle behind the present Library Square, in which the students had
their recreations. The walled-in court was probably thought sufficient, and most assuredly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
until the whole College Park was enclosed, the unfortunate students would by no means
have been allowed to wander through it. The lodge, built in 1722 for a porter, at the north-east
end, seems to imply that the fencing was then in process.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>These improvements were followed rapidly by the building of a new Dining Hall,
commenced in 1740. A bequest of £1,000 seems to have been the only help required, and
in 1745 it was even adorned with some of the portraits which still survive. But in 1758
this Hall was so unsafe that it was taken down, and after dismissing the College bricklayer
for his work,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the present Hall was set up on the same site, and apparently without change of
plan. It must be added, in extenuation of the bricklayer’s conduct, that the ground in that
part of the College affords very insecure foundations, as we know from recent experiences.
The present building has many great cracks in it, and the new rooms just added have had
their foundations sunk to a great depth.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> What is, however, more interesting as history, is
to note that the style of this Hall, not finished till after 1760, is rather the plain and
panelled building of the preceding generation. The Theatre (Examination Hall) is decorated
in a very different, but not, perhaps, a better style.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
THE OLD CLOCK TOWER.</div>
</div>

<p>While this work was going on, bequests of £1,000 were left to build an ornamental
front and tower at the west end of the old Hall; and the well-known architect, Cassels, did
so, close to, but a little west of, the site of the present belfry, in 1745. In this the present
great bell, cast at Gloucester in 1742, was hung.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The aspect of the court, therefore, upon
entering the gate, was that of a small square, closed towards the east with a building much
nearer than the present belfry. The centre of this east range had the ornamental front and
belfry of Cassels’ design, which, according to the extant plan, must always have been ugly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and looks very top-heavy.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The north and south sides of this Front Square (built 1685) were of
inferior character; while the small quadrangle beyond, on the south side, including the Provost’s
lodging, was still the original structure of Queen Elizabeth’s time. The bell tower was taken
down as unsafe, and the Hall removed, at the
close of the century. We see, therefore, that in
this great building period there were many serious
mistakes made. There was so much work of the
kind going on all through the city, that there must
have been a scarcity of competent artisans, and
much hurry. The buildings which remain are
indeed solid and well finished; but when we
attribute these characteristics to all the Dublin
buildings of that date, we forget that their bad
work has long since perished&mdash;what was done well
and carefully is all that has remained. While
Cassels was building his unsound tower, he
erected another pretty building according to a
bequest of Bishop Stearne&mdash;the Printing-House,
from which issued in 1741 an edition of seven
dialogues of Plato, in a good though much-contracted
type (which is still preserved in the
office), and on good paper, but disfigured by
a portentous list of errata. The book is now
rare, and in request among bibliographers. A
few years later, neat editions of Latin Classics issued from the same press.</p>

<p>This architectural activity, based upon liberal but insufficient bequests, somewhat
excuses the systematic begging petitions with which the College approached the Irish
Parliament for the rebuilding of the Front Square, Theatre, and Chapel, petitions which that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Parliament seemed never tired of granting, and yet never able to satisfy. If the taste for fine
building and the Parliament in College Green had not both expired with the end of the century,
Trinity College would now be the most splendidly housed College in the world. Even as it
is, intelligent visitors cannot but be struck with the massive and dignified character of its
buildings. Queen Anne and George I. had already granted (in three sums) £15,000 for the
Library. George II. granted £45,000 for the present Front Square and Examination Hall.
George III., besides the relief of £70 yearly in pavement-tax, granted (in 1787) £3,000, in
response to a petition for £12,000. So that, in all, the country granted the College at least
£60,000 for building during the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It is set forth in these various petitions
that the beauty of the metropolis is one of the objects to be attained, as well as the health
of the students, and accommodation for increasing numbers.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> There was a curious hesitation
about the plan of the west front. A central dome and two cupolas at the north and
south ends were designed; the south cupola was actually finished. Anyone who enters
the present gateway will see clearly that it is designed to sustain a dome. But this dome
was never built; the southern cupola was even taken down in 1758, and the front left as
it now stands.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>These buildings are still far the best and most comfortable in the College. All the
bedrooms have fire-places, and even the inner walls are nearly three feet thick. The rooms
in the towers and beside the gate are very spacious; and as we may presume that the
streets in front of the College were not so noisy as they now are, were evidently intended
as residences for Fellows, and were occupied by them exclusively till the rise of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
societies, to which they have afforded excellent reading and committee rooms. Thus they
remain to the present day a noble and practical monument of the enterprise shown by the
College and the Irish Parliament in the eighteenth century. It is now no longer the city only,
but the country which is interested in the College. Constant private bequests added to the public
liberalities no small increments; and so far as material prosperity was concerned, the history
of the College during the century is one of continued growth in popularity and importance.</p>

<p>When we turn to the internal history, the estimate afforded us by the facts recorded
is by no means so satisfactory. As has been already told, the Jacobite spirit at the opening
of the century, and the violent efforts of Provost Baldwin to subdue it, produced the
insubordination which usually accompanies tyrannical conduct among young men of spirit
living in a free country. Dignified as the Provost affected to be, he was exposed to personal
insults more than once, not only from Fellows, but from students. Some facts have been
collected by Dr. Stubbs, from whose work I quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the reigns of Queen Anne and of the first two Georges, the annals of the College
show that the Society suffered from much insubordination on the part of certain of the Students.
This partly arose from laxity of discipline, and from the influence of some disorderly and violent
Students, and partly from political causes which were connected with the party feelings which
prevailed [as at Oxford] with regard to the Revolution and the Hanoverian Succession. It is quite clear
that the great majority of the Fellows, especially of the Senior Fellows, were loyal to Queen Anne and
to the House of Hanover. Yet it could not be expected that an unanimity of views should prevail
among the Students. There appears to have been a small, but determined, body among them warmly
attached to the fortunes of James the Second and his family, while the governing body of the
College resolutely determined to suppress all manifestations of disloyalty to the reigning Sovereign.
The earliest instance of this is a case which occurred in 1708. One Edward Forbes, on the same
day on which he was admitted to the M.A. degree (July 12), took occasion to make a Latin speech,
in which he asserted that the Queen had no greater right to sit on the throne than her predecessor
had&mdash;that the title of each Sovereign <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eodem nititur fundamento</i>. This speech is said to have been
made at the Commencement supper. Forbes’ words, having been repeated to the authorities, gave
great offence to the loyal feelings of the heads of the College, and to the leading members of the
University, and the orator was consequently expelled from the College, and suspended from his
degrees by the act of the Provost and Senior Fellows. On the 2nd of the following month, at a
meeting of the Vice-Chancellor, Masters, and Doctors of the University, Forbes was deprived of his
degrees, and degraded from his University rights; on the same occasion a declaration of loyalty was
put forward by the leading members of the University Senate, and signed by the Vice-Chancellor, the
Archbishop of Dublin, and the Provost. This document, with the names of the signatories, is
preserved in the College Library. [<em>Cf.</em> Appendix xxxiv. of Dr. Stubbs’ work.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>A strong party of Graduates was dissatisfied with the action of the Provost and Senior Fellows
in the case of Forbes, partly from political reasons, and partly, perhaps, from a feeling that the
punishment awarded was more severe than the circumstances of the case required. There can be no
doubt that the sentiments of the members of the Board agreed very closely with those of the Whig
party. We learn, however, from Dr. Edward Synge, afterwards Archbishop of Tuam, that Forbes had
a party of sympathisers in the University. He says in his pamphlet, which he wrote vindicating his
well-known sermon on Toleration, preached in 1711:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I remember particularly the constant efforts made in the University of Dublin (by persons without doors against
the judgment of the Provost and Senior Fellows, who did all they could to oppose them, and, thank God, prevailed), at
every Commencement for several years, to procure a repeal of the sentence against Forbes, and a rasure (namely, from
the Register of the University) of those wicked words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eodem nititur fundamento</i>, which placed the title of the late Queen
on the same foot with that of her glorious predecessor.</p></div>

<p>There was still a small, but troublesome, party among the Students who agreed with Forbes in
his political opinions, for we find from the College Register, under the date August 17, 1710, that
Thomas Harvey, John Graffan, and William Vinicomes, were proved to have been intoxicated in the
College, and to have crossed over the College walls into the city, and Harvey was convicted of
inflicting an indignity on the memory of King William, by wrenching the baton out of the hand of
his equestrian statue erected in College Green in 1701. The other two aided and abetted him in the
act. They were all three expelled by the Board.</p>

<p>The heads of the College, as well as the leading Doctors and Masters, found it necessary to
clear the character of the College from the charges of disloyalty to Queen Anne which were
persistently brought against it. Accordingly, we find in the records of the proceedings of the Provost
and Senior Fellows, 14th July, 1712, that the Vice-Chancellor having signified that an address be
presented to her Majesty from the congregation in the Regent Houses, leave was given that such an
address be brought in.</p>

<p>On the 8th of February,
171<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">3</span>
  <span class="blka over">4</span>
</span>, Theodore Barlow was expelled for drinking in the rooms of one
of the Scholars to the memory of the horse from which King William was thrown, to the great
danger of his life, and also to the health of the Pretender, and for denouncing with a curse the
Hanoverian Succession. The heads of the College still deemed it necessary to set forth their loyalty
in the strongest terms, for the decree of expulsion of Barlow runs as follows. The words are
evidently those of the Vice-Provost, Dr. Baldwin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="la" xml:lang="la">

<p>“Visum est igitur Vice-Præposito et Sociis Senioribus, quibus imprimis cara est Wilhelmi Regis Memoria, qui ex
animorum suorum sententia juraverunt Annæ Serenissimæe Reginæ nostræ dignitatem et indubitatum Imperii titulum necnon
successionem in Illustrissimâ domo Hanoveriensi per leges stabilitam pro virili defendere et conservare.”</p></div>

<p>They had still to combat the hostile spirit of a portion of the University, who had now a new
Vice-Chancellor, Dr. John Vesey [?], Archbishop of Tuam, a man at that time of the age of seventy-seven;
and on the day after Barlow’s expulsion, at the Shrovetide Commencements, several Students
were prepared to take their degrees; but some of the Graduates and non-resident Masters of Arts
having caused a motion to be made to the Vice-Chancellor that the sentence of Forbes’ degradation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
should be read before any public business should be proceeded with, the Archbishop was in favour
of having this done; but the Vice-Provost, Baldwin, believing that this was for the purpose of having a
resolution passed repealing the sentence on Forbes, and relying on the College regulation that no grace
could be presented to the Senate of the University without the consent of the Board, negatived the
motion. The Vice-Provost’s negative was not allowed by the Vice-Chancellor, whereupon Baldwin
withdrew from the Regent House into the Provost’s house, followed by the rest of the Senior Fellows,
the Junior Proctor, and the Beadle. Then the Vice-Chancellor and Masters sent to them by two of
the Doctors of Divinity the following message:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Proctors, Registrar, and Beadle are cited and required to repair to the Regent House, under pain of contempt.”</p></div>

<p class="noindent">To which message the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows sent the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Proctors, Registrar, and Beadle, having communicated to the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows the message
sent to them by the Reverend Doctors Hamilton and Gourney, with all humility offer their opinion that they hold that
without the consent of the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows nothing can be safely done in this matter. And, moreover,
the Vice-Provost and Senior Fellows notify that they, with their above-named officers, will return without further delay, if
the Vice-Chancellor will proceed to confer degrees, and to transact the other business to which the Vice-Provost shall
have consented. Otherwise they must humbly beg to be excused, being unwilling to do anything contrary to the Charter
of Foundation, and the Laws and Customs of the University.”</p></div>

<p>Upon receiving this reply, the Vice-Chancellor adjourned the Commencement to the 11th of
February.</p>

<p>A final outburst of political feeling took place in 1715. On the 8th of April in that year, a
Student named Nathaniel Crump was expelled for saying that Oliver Cromwell was to be preferred to
Charles I.; and five of the Students were publicly admonished for breaking out of the College at
night, and attacking the house of one of the citizens. On the 31st of May, a Master of Arts, a
Bachelor of Arts, and an Undergraduate, were publicly admonished for reading a scandalous pamphlet
reflecting on the King, under the name of “Nero Secundus;” and a notice was placed upon the
gates of the College denouncing this pamphlet, and threatening the expulsion of all Students who
should read it or make a copy of it. The examinations for Scholarships and Fellowship proceeded
as usual, and on Saturday, the 11th of June, two days before the election, an order came from the
Lords Justices to the Provost and Senior Fellows forbidding the election, based upon a King’s Letter
of the 6th of June, and stating as the grounds of this prohibition the several disputes and tumults
in Trinity College, which disturbed the Students, and prevented them from studying for these
examinations. The elections, consequently, were not held, although there was [were] one Fellowship
and eleven Scholarships vacant.</p>

<p>On the 27th of June a Master of Arts was expelled for making a copy of the pamphlet “Nero
Secundus,” and two Bachelors of Arts were expelled for using language disrespectful to the King;
and on the 3rd of August two more of the Students were expelled on a like charge. On the 12th of
July the Provost and Senior Fellows petitioned King George I. with respect to the above-mentioned
prohibition. They denied that there were any disputes or tumults in the College which prevented
the Students for preparing for their several examinations, and stated that the number of candidates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for Fellowships was greater than usual, and the answering entirely satisfactory. They stated, moreover,
than none of the candidates for the vacant Fellowship or Scholarships were either accused or suspected
of any crime; but they had on all proper occasions expressed dutiful zeal to the King’s person and
Government. They asked permission to hold the election. Mr. Elwood and Mr. Howard were sent
to London to present this petition to the King.</p>

<p>On the 16th of February,
171<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">5</span>
  <span class="blka over">6</span>
</span>, the Prince of Wales was elected Chancellor, on the attainder
of the Duke of Ormonde, and the Provost and Dr. Howard were sent to London to present to his
Royal Highness the formal instrument of appointment.</p>

<p>On the 28th of April a letter was received from the Lords Justices, enclosing a copy of a
letter from the King, removing the prohibition to the election of Fellows and Scholars, and the
statutable examinations were held in the usual manner. On Trinity Monday one Fellow and thirty-four
Scholars were elected.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the MS. letters of Archbishop King in the College Library will
throw some light upon these proceedings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>June 4, 1715.</em> To Mr. Delafoy.&mdash;“The business of the College makes the greatest noise. Ten years ago I saw
very well what was doing there, and used all means in my power to prevent it; but the strain was too strong for me, as
you very well know, and ’twill be necessary to use some effectual means to purge that fountain, which otherwise may
corrupt the whole kingdom. Their Visitors are only the Chancellor and I. We ought to visit once in three years, but I
could never prevail on their Chancellor to join with me, though I often proposed it;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> nor is there any hope that I shall
be able to do any good whilst I am under such circumstances. I take the Chancellor to be for life, and this makes an
impossibility. I believe the Parliament when it sits will be inclined to look into this matter.”</p>

<p><em>June 21, 1715.</em>&mdash;“The College readily submitted to his Majesty’s order to forbear their elections, and I hope will
acquit themselves much better than the University of Oxford has done by their programme.”</p>

<p><em>July 7, 1715.</em> To Mr. Addison.&mdash;“The business of the College gives a great deal of trouble to every honest man,
and a peculiar pain to me. ’Tis plain there’s a nest of Jacobites in it: one was convicted last Term; two are run away;
and I believe bills are found against one or two more. But we can’t as yet reach the fountains of the corruption; but I
assure you no diligence is wanting, and everybody looks on it to be of the last consequence to purge the fountain of
education. I believe next Parliament will look into the matter.”</p></div>

<p>In addition to political feeling, there appear to have been from the beginning of the eighteenth
century a few very disorderly Students in the College, who were always giving trouble to the
authorities.</p>

<p>During the Provostship of George Browne, one of the worst riots took place in the College,
fortunately unattended at the time by loss of life. [The Provost died of its effects!] College discipline
had become disorganised in the unsettled period which succeeded the battle of the Boyne, and the
Provost and Senior Fellows resolved to subdue the disorderly spirit which had manifested itself in the
College. They determined to admonish publicly three or four of the Students who had been particularly
disorderly, and the heads of the College proceeded in a body to the Hall for that purpose. A few
determined Students advanced resolutely, tore the Admonition paper out of the hands of the Dean, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
turned the Provost out of the Hall. It was probably on this occasion that Provost George Browne
received the blow which has been mentioned in a previous page. A later instance of similar insubordination
occurred about thirty years afterwards, when the Provost and Senior Fellows proceeded to the
Hall for the like purpose of punishing some turbulent Students. They were met on their way with
unseemly affronts and reproaches. The doors of the Hall were locked against them by the Students,
and they were obliged to break open the doors in order to promulgate their sentence.</p>

<p>In 1733 the rooms of one of the Fellows were attacked by six or eight of the Students, and
they perpetrated there disgraceful mischief and outrage. The rebellious spirit of some of the Students
went so far that, when they were expelled, or rusticated, they refused to leave the College, and the
authorities could not put them out without violence. One of the Students so expelled actually
assaulted a Senior Fellow in the Hall while the sentence of his expulsion was being read out. These
violent proceedings on the part of a few reckless Students were aided by outsiders, who always came
into College when riots were expected. Thus the unhappy disorders in the College had become
widely known, and were fast bringing the institution to the lowest disrepute.</p>

<p>A contemporary pamphlet complains that while there were in the College from five hundred to
six hundred Students between seventeen and twenty-four years of age, there were only twenty Masters
to control them. The Scholars objected to the statutable custom of capping the Fellows, and it states
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the Board meets to inquire into a violation of the Statutes on the part of the Students, the young gentlemen
who are conscious of their guilt assemble in the courts below; they have secured a number of their friends; they are
surrounded by a great crowd of their brethren; how many they may have engaged to be of their party is not to be
discovered, and they give, perhaps, plain intimations that they will not suffer them to be censured. Trusting in their
numbers, they will not suffer any one man to be singled out for an example.... Physical violence is consequently
to be expected by the Provost, Senior Fellows, and the Dean proceeding to the Hall to read out censures.</p></div>

<p>Primate Boulter’s letters throw some light upon the state of discipline in the College at this
time. Baldwin, now become Provost, most likely from his known devotion to the Whig party and the
Hanoverian Succession, and his efforts to subdue the Jacobite faction in College, was a man of a very
arbitrary and determined character. He appears to have used the full authority which the Statutes
gave him, and frequently summoned the two Deans, and removed from the College books the names
of disorderly Students without consulting the Board. Some of the Senior Fellows, notably Dr. Delany,
a strong Tory, whose politics were shared by his friend and colleague, Dr. Helsham, were opposed to
these arbitrary proceedings, and took measures in London to bring the matter before the Council, in
order to have the Provost’s statutable power in these matters curtailed. We learn from Boulter’s letters
to the Duke of Newcastle, that early in 1725&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Two Undergraduates of the College, one of them a Scholar, had company at their chambers till about an hour
after the keys of the College were carried, according to custom, to the Provost. When their company was willing to
go, upon finding the College gates shut, and being told the keys were carried to the Provost, the Scholars went to the Provost’s
lodgings, and knocked there in an outrageous manner. Upon the Provost’s man coming to the door to see what was the
matter, they told him they came for the keys to let out their friends, and would have them, or they would break open
the gates. He assured them the keys were carried to his master, and that he durst not awake him to get them, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the man withdrew. Upon their coming again to knock with great violence at the Provost’s door, he was forced to rise,
and came down and told them they should not have the keys, and bid his man and the porter take notice who they
were. The next day he called the two Deans to his assistance, as their Statutes require, and sent for the lads to his
lodgings. The Scholar of the house came, but not the other. To him they proposed his making a submission for his
fault in the Hall, and being publicly admonished there. This he made a difficulty in doing; and upon their proceeding
to the Hall, when he came out of the lodgings he put on his hat before the Provost and walked off. The Provost and
Deans went on to the Hall, and after waiting there some time to see whether he would come and submit, they expelled
them both.</p></div>

<p>The Scholar’s name was Annesley, a relation of Lord Anglesea, and through his influence
with the Lord Lieutenant (Lord Carteret) and the Visitors [and upon his apologising] he was
restored.... We find that he took the B.A. degree in 1726, and that of M.A. in 1729.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are told in a pamphlet, supposed to have been written by Dr. Madden, that one of the
Students, after a long course of neglect of duties, as well as for a notorious insult [committed] upon
the Junior Dean, was publicly admonished. In order to resent this punishment, ten or twelve of the
Students behaved themselves in a most outrageous manner; they stoned the Dean out of the Hall,
breaking into his rooms, and destroying everything in them. They continued to ravage other parts of
the College until the middle of the night, evidently endangering the life of the person who was the
object of their resentment. Dr. Madden adds that this was done “in a time of great lenity of
discipline&mdash;perhaps too much so.” “The Board offered considerable rewards for the discovery of the
perpetrators of these riotous proceedings; the Students retorted by offering higher rewards to anyone
who would bring in the informer, dead or alive. A threatening letter was sent to the Provost.
Strangers from town, as was usually the case, came into the College to assist in the pillage. One of
these attempted to set fire to the College gates; and had not some of the well-disposed Students
prevented this, they would have laid the whole College in ashes, as the flames would have caught
hold of the ancient buildings, extravagantly timbered after the old manner, and would have reached
the new buildings [the Library Square], and the flames could not then have been extinguished.”</p>

<p>One of the Junior Fellows, named Edward Ford, who had been elected in 1730, had rendered
himself particularly obnoxious to the Students. He was not Junior Dean; but he appears to have
been an obstinate and ill-judging man, who took upon himself to restrain the Students in an imprudent
manner. They resented this interference. He had been often insulted by them, and had received a
threatening letter. This caused him much dejection of spirits; and as his rooms had suffered in the
previous tumult, he kept loaded arms always by his side. One night he was asleep in his rooms
(No. 25), over a passage which then led from the Library Square into the playground (a walled-in enclosure
which at that time occupied the site of the present New Square). A loaded gun lay by his bedside.
Some of the Students threw stones against his windows, which was the usual way in which they annoyed the
College authorities. Ford rose from his bed and fired upon them from his window, which faced the playground.
Determined to retaliate, the band of Students rushed to their chambers, seized the fire-arms, which
they had persisted in keeping (although such had been forbidden, under pain of expulsion, by a decree
of the Board, March 24, 1730), and they ran back to the playground. In the meanwhile one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Scholars, who resided in the same house, seeing the danger in which Ford was placed, and knowing
the character of the man, managed to get into his bedroom, and strongly urged him to remain in bed.
Ford, with his characteristic obstinacy, would not listen to this advice, but went to the window in
his nightdress, when the Students seeing him, fired at the window, and wounded him mortally. Poor
Ford lingered in great agony for about two hours before he died. The Board immediately met and
investigated the circumstances of the murder, and expelled Mr. Cotter, Mr. Crosby, Boyle, Scholes, and
Davis, as being the authors of or participators in Mr. Ford’s murder. The Board employed Mr. Jones,
an attorney, to prosecute them for murder at the Commission Court, at which trial, however, they
were acquitted.</p>

<p>We learn from contemporary pamphlets that the feeling among the upper classes in Dublin was
greatly excited about this affair. Many, especially ladies, strongly took the part of the young men&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Fellows were the subjects of common obloquy; every little indiscretion of their former lives was ripped up;
everything they said or did had a wrong turn given to it. Numberless false stories about them were spread throughout the
kingdom. Some of them were publicly affronted in the Courts of Law by one of his Majesty’s servants for appearing to
do the common offices of every honest man. One noble Lord declared that a Fellow’s blood did not deserve an inquisition
which might detain a man one day from his ordinary business. However, the Judges (except one) all spoke loudly in
favour of the College, and specially the Chief Baron.</p></div>

<p>Primate Boulter is said to have often appeared astonished when he heard gentlemen talk as if
they were determined to destroy the Irish seat of learning. It is added that “many did this for the
purpose of injuring religion.” No doubt the true explanation of the animosity to the College is to be
sought in the strong political feelings which prevailed at the time. The Fellows were mainly Whigs,
and their opponents belonged to the Tory party.</p>

<p>Early in March,
173<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">4</span>
  <span class="blka over">5</span>
</span>, the Visitors cited the Provost, Fellows,
and Scholars to appear at a Visitation on the 20th of that month.
Primate Boulter wrote to the Duke of Dorset that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There have been such difficulties started from the College,
and so much listened to by their Vice-Chancellor, the Bishop
of Clogher [Dr. Stearne], that I fear the Visitation will
not prove such as will answer expectation. I have taken all
opportunities of desiring the Fellows and their friends to
avoid all needless disputes and oppositions for fear of their
falling into the hands of worse Visitors next Session of
Parliament. I hope and fear the best; but things do not promise
very well.</p></div>

<p>The above cited pamphlet states that “at the late inquiry into
the condition of the College, there could not be discovered more
than two or three insignificant points in which the Statutes were
deviated from by the Fellows.”</p>
</div>

<p>To this account we should add that Swift, who disliked and despised Baldwin, took a
great interest in the Visitation of 1734, and went down to give his opinion concerning the
management of the College, which he thought very bad. He also wrote to the Duke of
Dorset on the subject (Jan. 14, 1735). But the fact added by Dr. Stubbs, that after the
affair of Ford we hear no more of riots or of insubordination, shows that the mischief was
not deep-seated, but caused by some small knot of rowdies. It does not appear that they
were led by young men of the higher classes, for though many frequented the College at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that time, no names of prominence (save an Annesley) are mentioned in connection with
any of the outrages. Such disorders have always been rather the fault of the Governors than
of the students of the College. The course of Irish history is so uniform, the temper of the
various classes in the nation is so unchanged (as every student of Irish history knows), that
I do not believe the discipline which is so easily maintained now in Trinity College was ever
seriously endangered, and the very fact that so many brilliant and learned men were being educated
there at that period shows that its intellectual life was not impaired. The particular form of
the studies pursued cannot be easily estimated. An examination of the Laudian Statutes
shows that the authorities were not allowed in any way to change the subjects laid down
for the course in 1637. The whole body of the teaching, as already explained, was
oral, and each student reproduced in essays or disputations what he had been taught by
his tutor during the week. Hence it was that such short books as those written by Dudley
Loftus or Narcissus Marsh, though used by lecturers, were not formally proposed to the
students. Locke’s Essay, as we know, was introduced into the post-graduate studies by
the influence of Ashe and Molyneux before 1700, and has influenced the spirit of the
University ever since; but this, too, was outside the prescribed course. It was not till 1760
that, by a special statute, the Provost and Board were permitted to make such changes
in the course as they thought expedient. This permission, conceded long after it was
needed and indeed assumed,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> marks an epoch in the history of the College. But
it belongs to the reign, not of Baldwin, but of his enlightened and brilliant successor,
Andrews.</p>

of Oxford. In a curious book intitled <cite>Terræ Filius</cite> (London, 1726), which consists of a series of satires upon that University,
the anonymous author says&mdash;“It has, till of late, been a custom, from time immemorial, for one of our family
to mount the Rostrum at Oxford at certain seasons [during the Acts of the Term], and divert an innumerable crowd of spectators,
who flocked to hear him from all parts, with a merry oration, interspersed with secret history, raillery, and sarcasm....
Several indignities having been offered to the grave fathers of the University, they said to one another&mdash;‘Gentlemen, these are
no jests; if we suffer this, we shall become the sport of freshmen and servitors. Let us expel him.’ And, accordingly, <cite>Terræ
Filius</cite> was expelled during almost every Act.” And again (p. xi.)&mdash;“Though it has, of late years, been thought expedient
to lay aside the solemnity of a <em>Publick Act</em>, and it is very uncertain when <cite>Terræ Filius</cite> will be able to regain his antient
privileges.”
</p>
<p>
There is a frontispiece to the book, signed W. Hogarth, which represents an enraged Don tearing in pieces the
libel of the <cite>Terræ Filius</cite>, who is in the middle of an excited crowd of collegians and ladies. The author speaks of the
seditious spirit of Oxford in the very way that the spirit of Dublin is censured at the same time; and just as the <cite>Terræ Filius</cite>
of Oxford had been censured and persecuted when his jests became libellous, so in Swift’s day, just before the Centenary
time, one Jones, an intimate of Swift’s, had been deprived of his degrees for a satire, which Barrett has published as possibly
composed by Swift to aid his friend.&mdash;<em>Cf.</em> Barrett’s <cite>Early Life of Swift</cite> (London, 1808).
</p>
<p>
The heads at Oxford, holding public acts in 1712, stopt the mouth of the <cite>Terræ Filius</cite> (who is called a <em>statutable</em> orator
at this solemnity), having intelligence that he designed to utter something in derogation of the Reverend Mr. Vice-Chancellor,
<em>op</em>. <em>cit</em>. p. 100. This is probably the affair spoken of in J. C. Jeaffreson’s <cite>Annals of Oxford</cite>, ii. 224, but referred to
the year 1713. Mr. Jeaffreson has a whole chapter on the subject.</p></div>

obtained it in that way. And because this Gentleman has already showed himself one of the most usefull men in that

students, petitioners have expended considerable sums of money <em>in the purchase</em> of ground for the enlargement of their
park, the enclosing and finishing of which will be attended with considerable expense” (Taylor, p. 95). The fact here
officially stated, that the College increased its holding of land in Dublin by purchase during the eighteenth century, is very
interesting, and is probably to be explained by searching the Register.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> This seems to me one of the boldest acts of Baldwin. We should have expected to find the incompetent workman

<p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> The Dublin papers of June, 1744, speak with enthusiasm of the arrival of this great bell, “on which the mere
import duty was £20, and which all lovers of harmony allow to be the largest, finest, and sweetest-toned bell in the
kingdom. It was cast by the famous Rudhall of Gloucester.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> The picture given by Dr. Stubbs was possibly never realised. There are several extant views of the College
subsequent to 1745 and up to 1797, which all represent the belfry as a dome without the lantern or the vane, “consisting
of a harp and crown, copper gilt” (Stubbs, p. 187). A rare aquatint of 1784 does, however, give the vane, with other
details which are highly improbable. It was a habit to print architects’ drawings of buildings in process of completion,
as may be seen in Poole and Cash’s views, in which many plates give the intentions of the architect, which were never
carried out.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> Mr. Taylor, in his history, has given all the petitions and replies from the Journals of the House of Commons.
The following is the summary:&mdash;Queen Anne and George I. for Library&mdash;in 1709, £5,000; 1717, £5,000; 1721, £5,000.
George II. for Parliament Square&mdash;1751, £5,000; 1753, £20,000; 1755, £5,000 (£20,000 asked for in the petition):
1757, £5,000; 1759, £10,000. George III., in 1787, £3,000. Between the last two dates considerable sums were
obtained from the Board of Erasmus Smith.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83_83" id="Footnote_83_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> While the impossibility of defraying these expenses without a building fund is strongly urged in the various
petitions, another set of documents, the King’s Letters, issued for the increase of salaries of Provost, Fellows, and other
officers in 1758, 1759, 1761, and subsequently, state as the reason the great increase in the revenues of the College, which
justify such changes. No one seems to have thought of comparing these statements with the begging petitions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> No reasons are assigned by Dr. Stubbs, who reports these facts apparently from the Register; but we may
infer that the large square Hall over the gate was thought necessary for a Regent House, or Hall for the disputations
of the Masters, in place of the older room, which disappeared with the demolishing of decayed buildings; and by this
title we know that that Hall was originally known. This alteration of plan would make a dome impossible. As soon
as the central dome was abandoned, it would follow that the cupolas, one of which had been already finished, must
also be abandoned.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> This cannot easily be reconciled with the statement above made (p. 65), that Archbishop Vesey was Vice-Chancellor
in the previous year, and in the absence of the Chancellor could act as Visitor.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> The facts in Dr. Stubbs’ 10th chapter, especially the classical course of 1736, show that the 15th chapter of the old
Statute was liberally interpreted. Indeed Greek and Latin are there prescribed, but the books not specified. In Logic the
directions are far more precise. Nor was there any relaxation of the strict directions with regard to Latin Essays and summaries
of work, or to Disputations, which certainly lasted till the close of the 18th century.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Provost Andrews, a layman, but a Senior Fellow, and one of a
distinguished group of lay Fellows then in the College, succeeded less than
two years before George III. became king. His Provostship is perhaps
the most brilliant in the annals of the College. He was a man of elegant
tastes, of large acquaintance, of scholarship quite adequate to his position, and he
consequently did more than any of his predecessors or successors to bring the
Society over which he presided into contact with the best and greatest throughout
Ireland. Even under the stricter and more academic Baldwin, we learn from the
Register that a large number of the highest classes in Ireland had begun to
frequent the College.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> We may assume that under Andrews this tendency increased.
It was only necessary to prove that the education of Dublin was equal to that of the older
Universities, to induce men of property in Ireland to avoid the troubles and anxieties of
sending their sons by the roads and boats of those days to Oxford and Cambridge; and
thus we find that from the opening of the eighteenth century to the second decade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the nineteenth the great body of the Irish aristocracy was educated in Dublin. It would
have been so, even into recent days, if the Senior Fellows of the latter period had thought
earnestly about the dignity of the College.</p>

<p>The character of this Provost, according to his contemporaries and the historians of
the College, was very different from that of Baldwin. He is indeed accused of good living,
a great crime in a College Don, when it includes brilliant society and rich appointments;
mere over-eating and drinking incur little censure. But Andrews could speak Latin with
fluency and elegance, and we are glad to learn that in his day the Irish pronunciation did
not make him incomprehensible in Italy or France. He built and occupied the noble
Provost’s House,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which still remains one of the mansions that give to Dublin its
metropolitan aspect. He entertained handsomely, both in the new Dining Hall and at his
own House. He must have been the promoter and founder of the School of Music, which
has produced a series of excellent Professors, and created a distinct school of composition,
starting from that fortunate accident, a musical Peer&mdash;the Earl of Mornington, father of the
great Duke of Wellington. The principal Parliamentary grants for building were during
the extreme old age of Baldwin, so that I suspect the influence of Andrews,
who was then a Senior Fellow, and a member of the Irish House, must have been the
chief cause of this sudden liberality; for after the completion of the Library in 1724, there
is a pause in the Parliamentary grants till 1751, and again they disappear after 1759,
when Andrews became Provost, till 1787. But it is asserted in Duigenan’s pamphlet that
the grants of Baldwin’s time were not exhausted during the whole of Andrews’ Provostship.
I take it, then, that Andrews had ample funds for the fine buildings erected during his
office.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Constant increase of the College rents and constant bequests made it possible to
rebuild the Dining Hall in his time (1759-61), and no doubt much remained to be done
in making the new front, finished in 1759, habitable. There was much hospitality, and
good society was encouraged in the College. The greatest ceremony during his time was
the installation of the Duke of Bedford as Chancellor, which is thus described by the
Registrar:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Friday, Sept. 9 [1768].&mdash;This day his Grace John Duke of Bedford was installed Chancellor of our
University.</p>

<p>The Hall had been previously prepared by erecting a platform at the upper end, and a gallery for
the musicians at the lower end. The platform was erected 2 feet 6 inches from the floor and railed in. At
the back in the middle, under a canopy of green damask, and upon a semicircular step raised six inches
above the level of the platform, was placed a chair for the Chancellor, on the right hand a chair for the Vice-Chancellor,
and on the left another for the Provost. From these chairs on each side along the back and sides
down to the rails were raised seats and forms, and on the right side, advanced before those seats, were placed
two chairs of state for the Lord Lieutenant and his Lady. Over the door of the Hall, and eight feet
above the floor, was erected the gallery for the musicians, and along the sides of the Hall, between the
platform and gallery, were seats raised and forms placed, leaving a passage in the midst seven feet wide.
On the right side, next to the platform, part of the seats were enclosed as a box for the reception of such
ladies of quality whom the Chancellor should invite. The platform with its steps, the gallery and the seats,
were covered with green broadcloth. The passage through the midst of the Hall was covered with carpeting,
and the semicircular step under his Grace’s chair ornamented with a rich carpet.</p>

<p>When the Lord Lieutenant and his Lady, the Nobility, the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of the city, the
ladies of quality and fashion, and all who walked not in the procession, had taken their seats in the Hall,
the procession moved solemnly from the Regent House, the chamber over the gateway, to the Hall in the
following order, according to juniority:&mdash;Undergraduates, Bachelors of Arts, candidates for Degrees, Masters
of Arts, Bachelors in Music, in Law, in Physic, in Divinity, Doctors in Music, in Law, in Physic, in Divinity,
Senior Fellows, Noble Students, Vice-Provost, Beadle with his Mace, Proctors, Chancellor between the Vice-Chancellor
on his right and the Provost on his left, Archbishops, Dukes, Earls, Viscounts, Bishops, Barons,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Every gentleman who walked in the procession was habited in the robes of his Order and Degree.
The Undergraduates and Bachelors of Arts stopped at the Hall-door, opened to right and left, and after the
Nobility entered the Hall according to seniority. The candidates for Degrees, Masters in Arts, and Bachelors
in Music, Law, Physic, and Divinity, stopped at the steps of the platform. The Doctors, &amp;c., ascended the
platform by four steps. During this procession the musicians played a solemn March composed on the
occasion by the Earl of Mornington, Professor of Music.</p>

<p>The music having ceased, the Registrar read the Act of the College constituting his Grace their
Chancellor. Upon which the Vice-Chancellor and the Provost, assisted by the Seniors, led his Grace to the
canopy and installed him. And the Vice-Chancellor having taken his place on the right, when the Mace and
the University Rules were laid at his feet, the Provost, assisted by the Seniors, delivered into his Grace’s
hand a printed copy of the College Statutes elegantly bound, promising for himself and the University all
due and statutable obedience. His Grace then arising returned them thanks for the honour they had done
him in electing him their Chancellor, expressing that it was more pleasing to him, as this mark of the
confidence of a Body so distinguished by their learning, virtue, and loyalty, gave him reason to hope that
his conduct during his administration was not disagreeable to the people of Ireland in general, whose
prosperity and welfare, and particularly the honour and privileges of the University, he would seek every
occasion to advance, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Provost having taken his place on the left, and the Seniors having retired to their seats, after a
short pause the Provost rose and addressed the Chancellor and the University in a most elegant Latin
oration, in the close of which he addressed himself particularly to the Professor of Music, who thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
gave the signal to the musicians, and gave copies of the Ode to the Lord Lieutenant and the Chancellor.
The Ode was written on the occasion by Mr. Richard Archdale, an Undergraduate, and was set to music by
the Professor, the Earl of Mornington.</p>

<p>After the conferring of the Degrees by the Chancellor, the Commencement was closed, and the
musicians played the March, as before, and the Procession, as before, attended his Grace to the Provost’s
House.</p>

<p>His Grace, with the Nobility, Fellows, Professors, &amp;c., dined in the Eating Hall. There were two
chairs placed at the head of the table; the Lord Lieutenant sat on the right hand.</p>

<p>Sunday, Sept. 11.&mdash;His Grace the Chancellor was sung into Chapel by the Choir. He sat in the
Provost’s stall, the Provost in the Vice-Provost’s; the Vice-Provost, Nobility, and Professors, were seated in
the adjoining seats. Two Senior Fellows read the Lessons, the Deans the Communion Service. The
Professor of Divinity preached from Proverbs, chap. xv., verse 14. There were two Anthems. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te
Deum</i> and the <em>Jubilate</em> were composed by the Earl of Mornington.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Sept. 13, the Chancellor, attended by the Provost, Fellows, and Professors, visited the
Elaboratory, Anatomy School, Waxworks, &amp;c. In the Natural Philosophy School his Grace was addressed
by Mr. Crosbie, a <em>Nobilis</em>, son of Lord Brandon, in English verse.... As his Grace was quitting the
Library, the Professor of Oratory addressed him in an English farewell speech, which his Grace was pleased
to answer with great politeness.</p></div>

<p>The reader will remember that the Hall mentioned at the opening of this extract was
the old Hall, then entered under the dome which appears in all the views of the College
of that epoch. The date of the first edition of the Statutes (August 22, 1768), when
compared with this account, also shows that they were first printed for the purpose of
this ceremony. The Chancellor’s copy of these Statutes had probably been lost, or never
perhaps handed over to the Royal Personages who had recently been Chancellors; and
indeed we wonder, with a printing press now over twenty years established, that the work had
not yet been issued in print. The difficulty lay in the Laudian Statute, which specially
provided that three copies should exist, and implied that no more should be circulated.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
There is possibly some entry in the Registry which would explain how the Board evaded
this obstacle. The printed copy bears opposite the title-page, in print, <em>vera copia, Theaker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Wilder, Reg<sup>r</sup></em>.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the Ode, with Mornington’s music, has disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
It is stated by Dr. Stubbs that the Duke of Bedford’s fine portrait by Gainsborough,
now in the Provost’s House, was presented upon this occasion. But there is an
exactly similar picture in the Dublin Mansion House, which must surely have been
presented by Bedford, or acquired by the city, while he was Lord Lieutenant, seven years
earlier. The portrait, therefore, in the Provost’s House must be a replica, unless it was
presented to Provost Andrews much earlier than the date of the Installation. Our Bursar, in
his history, states with cold precision the large amounts spent upon dinners to the Viceroys
in these hospitable days. It does not appear that the feast given to the Duke of Bedford
was by any means as costly as some of those given in later years.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Such are the gossiping
details preserved concerning this Provost and his social doings in the College.</p>

<p>It might be easily inferred, were it not stated expressly in the angry controversies
with his successor, that the discipline of the College was much relaxed, and many
abuses tolerated by this amiable man. The old Statutes regulating studies in the autumn
(out of term) had fallen into desuetude; the Chapel was shut up in July, and all business
ceased for six weeks. Residence was not enforced at this time, or indeed at other times,
in the case of poor scholars, who went as tutors into country houses. Still worse, the
marriage of several Fellows, in spite of their solemn oath of celibacy during their tenure,
was connived at, and thus a habit tolerated of trifling with solemn obligations, which not only
brought great scandal upon the College, but lowered the general dignity and respectability
of the Governing Body. Most of them were in debt to the College, and with the
expectation of never having payment enforced. It also appears accidentally, from a
document printed by Taylor, that the Wide Street Commissioners, making a report to the
Irish Parliament in 1799 on the condition of the College property extending from the north
precinct to the river, found that the houses and land had, by some great oversight, been let
on a long lease (60 years), at a small rent, to the Bishop of Raphoe.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>We may assume that the great social successes of Andrews’ Provostship encouraged
the Government, on his death, to promote another layman, and lawyer, into the vacant post.
It was doubtless argued that, with the increase of wealth and splendour in the College, it
must be represented by a public man, a man of the world, and a good speaker. But the
new Provost, John Hely Hutchinson, lacked other and not less necessary qualifications
which had made Andrews so successful. In the first place he had never been a Fellow, and
thus was not only ignorant of the routine of College work, but also of the characters and
susceptibilities of the Fellows. It was but natural that such of them as were baulked in
their advancement by his appointment, and who thought themselves more worthy to hold it,
resented the promotion of a stranger by political influence. Though Hutchinson managed
to gain over certain members of the Board, he found others irreconcilable, and he is
alleged to have dealt with them in unscrupulous fashion, both by attempted bribery and by
open oppression. The moral standard of his profession, and indeed of the official classes
throughout Ireland, was very low. Every successful man seems to have feathered his
nest by obtaining or creating sinecures, nor was there any limit to the rapacity which
accumulated them in the same hands. It was well that Hutchinson did not set himself to
plunder the College for his family; the few cases of inferior officers whom he thrust upon
the College, which his adversaries have exposed, are mere trifles.</p>

<p>But he was ambitious of political power for his sons; and he certainly strove to make
the College a pocket-borough. This attempt brought about him a nest of hornets. The
fact was, that bribery or intimidation, which might be used with hardly any risk in
constituencies of ordinary electors, was sure to stumble upon some young gentleman of
high character and independence among the Fellows or Scholars, and thus be exposed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the abuses tolerated by Andrews gave the new Provost a great
power of intimidation, which he could have used very effectually. Fellows with wives and
large families, who had broken their solemn engagement to celibacy, and resided outside the
College, contrary to the Statutes, who, moreover, owed to the College large sums of money
for the purchase of rooms, which they could not pay, were practically in the Provost’s hands.
It is much to be regretted that when a layman, an outsider, and a public man chanced to
be set over the Society, he did not take in hand thorough reforms on these all-important
points&mdash;reforms which could hardly be expected from an old member of the Corporation,
promoted after years of acquiescence or participation in the growing laxities of discipline.</p>

<p>But the school in which Hutchinson was educated was even morally worse than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the culpable Fellows. There must be substantial truth in the constant allegation, proved
by two Parliamentary inquiries, that the Provost’s assertions of discipline were not just and
uniform, but intended to promote his political power. Both in 1776 and in 1790, when
Hutchinson secured the return of his elder and younger sons respectively by a very narrow
majority, there were petitions against them on the ground of intimidation and bribery, and
the evidence then given is the real ground of the severe judgment which the local historians
have pronounced against the Provost. In the former petition his son was unseated; in the
latter&mdash;remarkable for having Lord Edward Fitzgerald and the future Duke of Wellington
among its members&mdash;the casting vote of the chairman saved the sitting member. The
evidence in both cases is so very similar, that we cannot but wonder at the incaution of the
Provost, who was probably saved from a second disgrace only by his personal influence
with the Chairman of the Committee. In this latter case, however, Hutchinson disowned
altogether the person who acted as go-between, and who made offers to the scholars. He
was private tutor to the Provost’s family, but was dismissed, and excluded from the precincts
of the College by order of the Visitors.</p>

<p>The case is therefore strong against the Provost, though we should remember that in
those days all Parliamentary elections in Ireland were carried on by similar means, and that
bribery was only condemned by the law, not by the moral sense of the community.</p>

<p>This public evidence has, however, not weighed in the minds of historians so strongly
as the violent pamphlet called <cite>Lachrymæ Academicæ</cite>, written against the Provost by his bitter
personal enemy, Dr. Patrick Duigenan, who as a Junior Fellow was at perpetual variance
with his chief, and at last resigned his Fellowship to take a Chair of Law, which was
increased in value (with the Provost’s consent) to induce his resignation. This exceedingly
violent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</i> statement seems to me chiefly valuable for its allusions to the internal
affairs of the College not at issue in the dispute. The tone is scurrilous, and the confident
prediction that a few more years of the Provost’s manipulation must ruin the College
falsified by the facts. Instead of securing all the posts in the College for partizans of his
own, the Provost met with more and more opposition, especially from the Junior Fellows, as
years elapsed. In 1775, a scholar whom he had deprived insisted upon a Visitation, in
which Primate Robinson, the Vice-Chancellor, decided against the Provost. In 1791,
another Vice-Chancellor, Lord Clare, decided against him on the right of negative, which
he claimed under the Statutes in every election. The sense of the Statute is plain
enough. It ordains that the majority of Provost and Board shall decide elections; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
if such majority could not be obtained after two scrutinies&mdash;that is to say, if the Senior
Fellows had divided their votes among three or more candidates, so that none of them had
more than three&mdash;then the Provost’s vote, even if it stood alone, shall decide the election.
This very reasonable Statute was, however, so worded, that another interpretation was
possible, ordaining that even in an absolute majority of votes the Provost’s must be one.
Lord Clare decided rightly that the disputed words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">una cum Præposito, vel eo absente Vice-Præposito</i>,
merely meant that the Senior Fellows could not elect without the presence of
either of these officers.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>This Visitation concludes the long history of the quarrels of the political Provost
with his Fellows. He was then an old man, and though he showed considerable vigour in
arguing his case, it is evident that the fire of his ambition was burning low, and his
combativeness decreasing with the decay of his physical powers. It is a great pity that
while a collection of scurrilous tracts&mdash;<cite>Pranceriana, Lachrymæ Academicæ</cite>, and others&mdash;were
published and widely circulated, and are still quoted against him, his own account of the
history of the College, of his own doings, and of the character of his opponents, has remained
in MS., and even this MS. is not now in the Library, but in possession of Mr. Charles
Todd. It is therefore only known through the few extracts which those writers have made
who have had access to this source. The impression produced by these extracts is strongly
in Hutchinson’s favour; he speaks with admiration of some of his opponents, and with great
calmness of his own political mistakes. Until this important document is thoroughly
examined, the case for Provost Hutchinson cannot be considered complete, nor can we
determine all the motives of his policy. We can, however, infer from the public acts of
his government the following conclusions.</p>

<p>In the first place, he clearly desired to modernise the education of the students, not
only by modifying their course of study (of which Dr. Duigenan says he was an incompetent
judge), but by making them practise accomplishments quite foreign to old Collegiate
discipline. The account of his improvements suggests that he advanced in the direction
which Andrews had set for the College, but so rashly as to make his government a parody of
that of his predecessor. Having himself called out his man, and fought a duel, he could not
possibly interdict the use of arms among the students; and we hear strange and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
exaggerated accounts of the number of students killed or maimed in affairs of honour.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Akin to the practice of arms was the practice of horsemanship, which brought upon him
some ridicule when he desired to have a riding-school attached to the College. This idea
was probably suggested to him by country gentlemen, who thought that their sons should
receive a complete training for their after life in the University. The same ideas prompted
him to found Chairs of Modern Languages, which have lasted to this day, and which
proclaimed the startling novelty that not dead languages only, but the living languages of
Europe are part of a liberal education. However late and imperfect the teaching of modern
languages at the University may have been, we can here also infer that it was the
solicitation of parents of the higher classes which made Hutchinson propose these changes,
all of which tended to make the students men of the world.</p>

<p>As regards his own office, he did many things to promote its permanent dignity.
He persuaded the Board to give him a grant for enlarging the fine house which his
predecessor had built, and this addition is one of its chief features; it is the stately
Provost’s study, added at the north end of the main structure. He took care so to lease the
Provost’s estate as to preserve its rental undiminished to his successors. The same principles
appear in his improvement of the College. With the aid of a grant from the Erasmus
Smith’s Board of £2,500, he built the noble Examination Hall, intended for a Theatre or
Hall of public Academic performances, at the fortunate moment when our 18th century
builders had just reached the zenith of their art. No room in Dublin is more perfect in its
proportions, or more rich as well as chaste in its ornamentation. He also persuaded the
Senior Fellows, who trembled for their renewal fines, to have the College estates re-valued, and
thus added a permanent £5,000 a-year to the property of the Corporation. We are told that
he could not carry out this eminently honest and practical reform without guaranteeing each
of the persons who sat with him on the Board against loss of income. Not one of them
was willing to risk one shilling for the future improvement of the College estate. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
showed more questionable taste when he transformed a number of old silver cups into a
service of dinner plates, which his enemies said he intended for his own use, and probably
for that of his heirs; for he carried them to his suburban residence at Palmerstown [Park],
and used them in his entertainments. The service is, however, still safe, and perhaps adds
as much to the dignity of College entertainments as would the cups that were melted down.
But we grieve to think what splendid old specimens of Caroline or Queen Anne plate
have thus been lost.</p>

<p>So far as Hutchinson was a politician&mdash;probably accepting the Provostship with the
determination to have the University for a pocket-borough, and so to attain a position equal
to that of the County magnates&mdash;so far his life and conduct are open to severe criticism.
In every other respect his 20 years of rule were both brilliant and profitable to the College.
He continued the great traditions of his two predecessors, and far surpassed the men who
succeeded him for the next 40 years. But whether the opposition of the Fellows was really
irreconcilable, or whether he was himself wanting in tact or fairness, the painful result is
beyond question, that he lived all his life at war with his subjects.</p>

<p>When his health began to fail in 1793, a full year before his death, intriguing for the
succession to his place began in official circles. The Bar, who absorb so many posts outside
their profession, began to speak of the Provostship as a political office; and had they
succeeded in appointing another lawyer, we should presently have had it put forward as an
axiom, that none but a lawyer is fit to hold a post which requires any knowledge of the
law. We hear this absurd argument repeated every day with fatal effect. On the other hand,
the Senior Fellows, who had considered this great post as their proper prize ever since the
necessity of importing scholars from England had passed away, were equally zealous in
counteracting these schemes. Four or five times did they send deputations to London to
interview Pitt, Dundas, Portland, and perhaps with most effect Edmund Burke and the
Marquis of Abercorn, both of whom exerted themselves warmly against the politicians and
the lawyers in favour of an academical and clerical appointment. Even Burke himself was
spoken of for the office, and then an English Bishop of Cloyne, Bennett, who was deterred
by a threatening visit from some of the Fellows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the moment for the celebration of the Bi-Centenary of the Foundation
had arrived. The Centenary had been held in 1694, the 100th anniversary of the first
taking of degrees. The more correct date would have been 1692. But neither date was
debated for one moment by the creatures who were thinking of nothing but the loss of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
step in their promotion, or the chances of succeeding to a lucrative post. All remembrance
of the dignity of the College and its historic position was obscured by these personal
anxieties, to which was added, in the minds of better men, a keen sense of the inconvenience
of having a stranger and a politician as the head of a place of learning. Had any of the
three great Provosts been guiding the councils of the College, this disgraceful omission of
so honourable a commemoration would not have been tolerated.</p>

<p>But from this time onward, the College, having conquered in the great struggle
concerning Hutchinson’s successor, obtained the practical nomination, and accordingly “the
Senior Major of the Regiment,” or the next senior, was regularly promoted. By a curious
coincidence, the influence of Primate Boulter’s policy, and the exclusion of Irishmen from
Bishoprics, had also passed away, and so we find our Provosts passed on to the Episcopal
Bench, leaving no mark upon the College, and taking no interest in ought beyond the
decent management of the routine studies of the place. The history from the appointment
of Murray to that of Bartholomew Lloyd, in 1837, is probably the least creditable in all the
three centuries. No fine buildings were erected during these years. Even the belfry
which was taken down was not rebuilt, and the great bell relegated to a shed in a remote
corner of the College, where it lay for fifty years, till the munificence of a Chancellor
educated at Oxford retrieved the disgrace. When the old Chapel was removed, so careless
were these men of 1798 of the memories of the dead, that the alabaster monument of the
pious founder, Luke Challoner, was thrust aside, not even into a shed, but into a corner,
where the recumbent figure was defaced by the weather beyond recognition within thirty
years. During the rule of the great Provosts there had been frequent bequests from rich
members of the Society, who justly held that some practical expression of gratitude was
due to the College which had conferred upon them wealth and dignity. That spirit died
out with the century. From that day onward, many men drew £50,000 in salaries from the
College, and did not return to it one farthing beyond their (often second-rate) official work.
Constant gifts of plate from rich students, as well as Fellows, <em>for the use of the College</em>, had
replaced the tax for <em>argent</em>, at one time levied (as it still is in some Oxford Colleges) on
all who entered the College. These honourable gifts were no longer made, though any
but a criminally supine set of rulers could easily have kept them up by example and
advice. In fact, the existing plate was concealed in the safes of the Board-room, and never
issued except for the Provost’s private use. During these disgraceful forty years no public
display brought the College into notice except the lavish feast to George IV. (1821). At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the same time, the number of students was very great, the incomes of Seniors in renewal
fines, and of Juniors in Tutors’ fees, larger than they ever were before or since; yet these
were the years which justly earned for the University of Dublin the now obsolete title of
“Silent Sister.” There was a day when Oxford, for like reasons, had obtained the kindred
name of “the Widow of Sound Learning.”</p>

<p>And yet the moment when Murray succeeded was one more than likely to stimulate
bright spirits to do brilliant work; it was the moment when revolutionary ideas from the
Continent were making their way into Ireland; when hot-headed politicians were speaking
of National Independence, of Republicanism, of the Rights of Man; it was the age that
bore the great poets of the early nineteenth century. One of them, Thomas Moore, whom
his greatest contemporaries have recognised and honoured as their peer, was actually a
student of Trinity College. He was the last of a considerable series of playwrights and
poets, which proves that English studies, at all events, were not neglected in the College
course. Congreve, Swift, Goldsmith, Parnell, Sheridan, not to speak of Brady and Tate, and
Toplady, prove what Burke mentions in acknowledging the honorary degree offered him by
Hutchinson&mdash;“I am infinitely pleased that that learned body ... condescends to favour
the unaltered subsistence of those principles of Liberty and Morality, along with some faint
remains of that taste of Composition, which are infused, and have always been infused, into
the minds of those who have the happiness to be instructed by it.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> He might have
added another all-important training in expression, which used to be a peculiarity of the
Dublin Classical School, and which Chatham devised as a means of making his son the
prince of debaters. It consisted in the practice of free <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i> translation from Greek
and Latin into English, wherein the fluency of expression was rated as of equal importance
with grammatical accuracy. When we competed for Scholarships in the earlier half of the
century, we were required to know a long course of authors in this way; and surely to express
the thoughts of another language in fluent English is the best preparation for those
who desire to express their own thinking in apt and ready words. So far, then, the
narrowness of the Governors was not able to affect the students. Those who went into the
world became practical orators of the first rank, while those who remained in the College
sank into learned insignificance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the time, as I have said, was full of excitement, political and social. There were
wars and rumours of wars, some men’s hearts failing them for fear, others beating with the
expectation of a millennium of Liberty. It was impossible that the great agitation of the
country should not reach the ardent spirits whom the late Provost had permitted or encouraged
to mix in the world. They had, moreover, started a debating club, the Historical Society,
which, after various modest beginnings and failures, became of recognised importance
towards the waning of the century. The very essence of these debating societies is to
transgress sober discipline; for while it is the duty of Governors of a College to keep their
students’ attention upon abstract science, pure philosophy, and classical languages, it is the
one aim of debaters to avoid such subjects, and choose those of present and burning
interest. Moreover, in those days the modern engines of the press and the platform had not
accustomed men to discount the mendacities, the false passion, the gross exaggerations
of political oratory. Generous natures were more easily carried away than they now are,
when the poison and the antidote succeed one another in the columns of the same newspaper.
Wolfe Tone found even among the Fellows two distinguished men, John Stack and
Whitley Stokes&mdash;these family-names have been for more than two centuries frequent in the
honour-rolls of the College&mdash;who adopted the views of the United Irishmen, and admitted the
principle of making Ireland an independent nation. It is hard to avoid the observation that
Boulter’s policy of filling every post of importance with English placemen must have been
a powerful agent in turning the opinions of the professional men in Ireland in this direction.
Presently the College was seized with military ardour; a yeomanry corps was established, in
which four companies were commanded by four lay Fellows, for the purpose of aiding the
Government in the impending crisis. But along with the ardour for amateur soldiering so
universal among civilians, there crept in the feeling that, with arms in their hands, men should
secure not only peace and order in the country, but some recognition of the claims of Ireland,
so long neglected and postponed to the most vulgar English interests. One of the captains
was, in fact, already an United Irishman, though he seems to have been deterred from
going as far as Wolfe Tone would lead him, by Tone’s open assertion that the liberties of
the country must be attained even through arms and blood.</p>

<p>Presently it became necessary to revive the dormant Statute forbidding students to
attend any political meetings; and when some of the scholars went so far as to avow
publicly that they were United Irishmen, in the sense then considered seditious, and one
member at least of the Board, who was also M.P. for the University, openly declared himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
opposed to taking extreme measures against them, the time seemed come for a formal Visitation.
In all this difficult and dangerous passage of the history of the College the Provost is hardly
mentioned. The result of the great battle between the Dons and the politicians upon
Hutchinson’s death had resulted, as has been said, in the appointment of the Vice-Provost,
Murray, a respectable, modest, benevolent old man,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> wholly unfit to guide the counsels of
the Board, or to lead back the wilder students into the paths of discretion or common sense.
Moreover, the ultra-Protestant party were in such panic at the state of the country as to
make them cruel in their punishments. The Vice-Chancellor was Lord Clare, a very strong
and uncompromising member of the Protestant ascendency, who all through his life was
perfectly consistent in advocating the English supremacy, and in crushing out all Irish aspirations,
even with the halter and the sword. He had been baulked in his policy of repression
by the admission of Roman Catholics to Degrees in Trinity College, carried in 1793 by an
Act of Parliament, but which would not have been put into effect in that year but for the
stout action of Dr. Miller, who, as Senior Master Non-Regent, stopped all the conferring
of Degrees till the Vice-Chancellor consented to remit the old oath against Popery. The
facts, which are worth knowing in their details, are thus stated by Dr. Stubbs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the first Commencement day after the passing of the Act of Parliament arrived, the
Letters Patent altering the College Statutes had not been prepared, and consequently, although the
declaration had been abolished by Act of Parliament, the corresponding oath remained. Lord Clare
was well known to be opposed to the admission of Roman Catholics to Degrees, and he presided as
Vice-Chancellor of the University, and it was expected that he would place every impediment in his
power to the relaxation which had been granted by the change in the law. Mr. Miller, who was
called upon to act as Senior Master Non-Regent, declined to take his place until he had been formally
elected by the Senate, according to the letter of the University Regulations. After some opposition to
this proceeding on the part of the Vice-Chancellor, this legal formality was carried out, and Mr. Miller
took his seat as one of the Caput.</p>

<p>The usual form at Commencements at that time was, that the Proctor should first supplicate
for the Degrees to be conferred, and obtain the suffrages of the Senate, after which being done, the
oath and the declaration were read. On this occasion the Vice-Chancellor called on the Proctor to
commence by reading the statutable oath. So far no objection was made; but when that officer
proceeded to recite the declaration as of old, Miller immediately interfered, and reminded Lord Clare
that this declaration had been abrogated by Act of Parliament, and assured him that if it were then
insisted on he would, in his capacity as a member of the Caput, prevent any Degrees from being
conferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Clare was unprepared for this proceeding, and threatened to adjourn the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comitia</i>. However,
after referring to the Act, which Mr. Miller had by him, and after a consultation with Mr. Wolfe,
the Attorney-General, who was present in the Hall for the purpose of taking the Degree of Doctor of
Laws, Lord Clare soon saw that the clause in question, although conditional in the preamble, was
peremptory in its enactment, and that the Senior Master Non-Regent was right in point of law.
The declaration was not read, and the Commencement proceeded. Letters Patent were shortly afterwards
passed making the necessary alteration in the College Statutes, and from that time Roman
Catholics have taken lay Degrees without restriction.</p></div>

<p>It may therefore well be imagined that Lord Clare came in no very good humour
to visit the College, and that he probably desired to show to the public that the Act of
1793 had been followed by the consequences which the old ascendency party had foreseen,
and therefore urged against it. The second Visitor was Dr. Duigenan, a man intimate with
the College in former years, and a very good judge of the characters of the Fellows, now
that the old quarrels and animosities with the late Provost and his party had been
superseded by far graver questions. I will let Dr. Stubbs narrate the proceedings in his own
words.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Vice-Chancellor, on opening the proceedings, intimated that the object of the Visitors was
to inquire whether the disaffection imputed to the College was founded in reality, or was a mere
rumour or surmise; and he announced his intention to punish with severity any of the members of
the College who should be proved to be encouragers or abettors of treason or sedition. The roll of
the College was called, and to every member, as he answered his name, an oath was tendered, and
when sworn he was examined as to his knowledge of unlawful societies existing in College. Dr.
Browne was asked as to his vote at the Board in the case of Ardagh and Power, and he acknowledged
that he had considered expulsion too severe a measure, and therefore had, with two other Senior
Fellows, voted for the rustication of the two Students for a year as a suitable punishment, and that he
had publicly stated his opinion after the meeting of the Governing Body had terminated. For this
open criticism of the decision of the Board he was strongly rebuked by Lord Clare.</p>

<p>Whitley Stokes, when questioned by the Vice-Chancellor, denied that he knew of the existence
of societies of United Irishmen in the College, or of any illegal or secret societies within the walls.
He admitted that he had been a member of the Society of United Irishmen in 1791, before their
revolutionary tendencies had been developed; but he stated that from that period he had altogether
dissociated himself from them. He admitted that he had professionally visited, as a physician, a man
who was well known for his treasonable proclivities, but who was very ill and very poor, but always
in company of a third person, lest his action might be misrepresented. He had also subscribed to
a fund which was formed to relieve the necessities of two members of the United Irishmen who were
in prison. The most reliable evidence was given on Dr. Stokes’ behalf that he had used his influence
among the Students, which was considerable, to induce some of them to withdraw from treasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
associations, and to enroll their names among the members of the College corps, and that his efforts
had been successful. In fact, Lord Clare was forced to admit the concurring testimony of so many
respectable and independent witnesses in Dr. Stokes’ favour; at the same time he stated that he was
a well-meaning man who had been led into great indiscretions.</p>

<p>The Students soon appeared to be reluctant to take the oath, partly because they declined to
implicate others, partly because they were unwilling to make admissions which would criminate themselves.
At the end of the first day there were fifty who had refused to be sworn. In consequence
of this, Lord Clare intimated on the following day that if any of the Students who had been themselves
implicated in the proceedings of these treasonable societies would come forward and admit the fact,
and would promise that in future they would separate themselves from them, the Visitors would pass
over their previous complicity with these associations. Among those who had first refused to take
the oath was Thomas Moore. However, when the Vice-Chancellor had explained the matter to the
Students, Moore complied, and denied that he had any knowledge of treasonable practices or societies
in College. Many of the other Students who had at first declined to be sworn, on the second and
third days of the Visitation came forward and confessed their errors. The result of the inquiry of the
Visitors was the establishment of the fact that there were four committees of United Irishmen in the
College, the secretaries of which were Robert Emmett, Peter M‘Laughlin, the younger Corbett, and
Flynn. The sentence of the Visitors was to the effect that Thomas Robinson, Scholar, who had lent
his rooms for the meetings of the United Irishmen, and who had in his sworn evidence before the
Visitors prevaricated in his answers, was expelled from the College.</p>

<p>William Corbett, Dacre Hamilton, John Carroll, and David Shea, Scholars; and Thomas Corbett,
Peter M‘Laughlin, Arthur Newport, John Browne, and George Keough, Students, were also expelled
for contumacy in refusing to be sworn, and because they had fallen into the gravest suspicion, in the
opinion of the Visitors, of being acquainted with, and partakers in, a seditious conspiracy.</p>

<p>Robert Emmett, Thomas Flynn, John Penefather Lamphier, Michael Farrall, Edward Barry,
Thomas Bennett, Bernard Killen, and Patrick Fitzgerald, were expelled for contumacy in refusing to
appear before the Visitors, and because there was the gravest suspicion that they were acquainted with,
and had been partakers in, the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Martin John Ferrall was expelled because he admitted that he was acquainted with, and had
been engaged in, this conspiracy, and because he had not informed the authorities of it, nor had been
willing to do so.</p>

<p>As to Dr. Whitley Stokes, the Visitors decided that because he had confessed that he had
some intercourse with the heads of the conspiracy he should be precluded from acting as College
Tutor, and should for three years be disqualified from sitting as a member of the Board, and from
being co-opted to a Senior Fellowship.</p>

<p>These sentences were confirmed on the 1st of May, 1798, by the Duke of Gloucester, as
Chancellor of the University.</p></div>

<p>This drastic treatment, whether just or not, seems to have enabled the College to
tide over the crisis of 1798, and to emerge after the Union into that period when it reflects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the dulness and prosperity of the country. The last Provost of the century, Kearney, is
the type of his day. “This Provost,” says Taylor, with unconscious naiveté, “was always
remarkable for his close attention to whatever might be considered for his improvement.”
His only notable act was to refuse, <em>with tears in his eyes</em>, the resignation offered him, on
the ground of religious difficulties, by the pious John Walker, and to expel him publicly
next day. The same man connived at a number of his Fellows being married, in formal
violation of their oath. Over against these unwholesome features, and the stagnation in
the publishing of solid intellectual work, must be set the undoubted fact that there were
men of sound learning and research among the Fellows. Mat. Young, Barrett, Thos.
Elrington, Rich. Graves, Geo. Miller, were all men of respectable attainments in their day;
and if the classical school produced no compeer of the expelled John Walker, it was at
this apparently obscure period that the University of Dublin exchanged its reputation
as a school of theology, of eloquence, and of style, for the reputation in Mathematics
and Physics which was its only distinction in this century up to the reformations of
Bartholomew Lloyd.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Roman Catholics were not permitted to take Degrees in the University of
Dublin up to the year 1793. By an Act of the Irish Parliament of that
year, followed by a Royal Statute of the College in 1794, this disability
was removed, but neither Roman Catholics nor Protestant Dissenters could
at that time, nor for nearly eighty years after, be elected to Fellowships
or Scholarships on the foundation of the College. In 1843 an attempt was
made to contest the law on this point. Mr. Denis Caulfield Heron, a Roman
Catholic Sizar, became a candidate for Scholarship in 1843, and was examined
in conformity with the Statutes. There were sixteen vacancies, and his answering would
have placed him fifth in order of merit, but the electors did not consider him to be
eligible on account of his religion. Mr. Heron appealed to the Visitors, who declined to enter
into an inquiry on the subject. He then, in Trinity Term 1844, applied to the Court of Queen’s
Bench to grant a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</i> to force the Visitors to hear his appeal. This, after argument,
was granted by the Court in June, 1845. In accordance with this command, the Visitors
held a Court of Appeal in December, 1845, and they heard the arguments of eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
counsel on both sides, aided by their assessor, the Right Hon. Richard Keatinge. Their decision
was to the effect that, considering the precise and pointed language of the Act of 1793, and the
whole body of College Charters and Statutes, it was the clear intention of the Crown, by the
Royal Statute of 1794, merely to give to Roman Catholics the benefit of a liberal education and
the right to obtain Degrees, but without allowing them to become members of the Corporation
of Trinity College, or in any manner changing its Protestant character.</p>

<p>In order that the students who were not members of the then Established Church should
not be debarred from the advantages of Scholarships, the Board in 1854 decided to establish a
class of “Non-Foundation Scholars,” which should not be restricted to any religious denomination.
The Scholarships were awarded as the results of the same examination by which the Foundation
Scholars were elected, and were confined to those whose answering at the Scholarship Examination
was superior to that of the lowest of those who were elected to Foundation places. The
tenure and the value of the Non-Foundation Scholarships was the same as of those on the
Foundation, and they were awarded for good answering either in Mathematics or in Classics.</p>

<p>Matters remained in this state until the year 1873, when the late Mr. Fawcett, afterwards
Postmaster-General, succeeded in passing an Act of Parliament, 36 Vic. c. 21, with the full assent
of the College authorities, which abolished Tests in the University of Dublin, except in the case
of Professors and Lecturers in the Faculty of Theology, and opened all offices and appointments
in the College to every person, irrespective of his religious opinions.</p>

<p>At the time of the Union with Great Britain, in 1800, the University lost one of its two
members, but it continued to return one member to the Imperial Parliament, the electors being,
as before, the Provost, Fellows, and Foundation Scholars. This constituency, taking account
of minors, fell much short of one hundred. By the Reform Act, in 1833, the second member
was restored to the University of Dublin, but the constituency was enlarged so as to include
ex-Scholars, Masters of Arts, and Doctors in the several faculties, and special Commencements
were held in the following November, at which a very large number of Masters’ degrees were
conferred; the number of registered electors at once rose to 1,570. The constituency now
numbers 4,334.</p>

<p>The history of Trinity College during the first half of the nineteenth century offers but
little to note, apart from the great advances which were made in the studies of the University and
the Professional Schools, and which will be hereafter detailed in their proper places. The increase
in the funds of the College admitted, and the requirements of the College demanded, an
augmentation in the number of Junior Fellows from fifteen to eighteen. This increase was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
made by a Royal Statute in 1808. It was enacted that there should be no election to any of
these Fellowships in any year in which there was a natural vacancy, and that in the case of no such
vacancy happening, one of these new Fellowships should be filled until the number of three was
in this way completed. These three additions were made in the years 1808, 1809, and 1811. In
the years 1802, 1803, 1804, and 1806 there had been no Fellowship vacant at the time of the
annual elections, and, but for this addition, from 1802 to 1811 there would have been seven years
without a Fellowship Examination.</p>

<p>At this period, although the Statutes of the College forbade the marriage of the Fellows,
yet it was well known that for a good many years many of them more or less openly violated the
law of the College in this respect. In some cases their wives continued to be known by their
maiden names; and the public understood this, and did not discountenance it. In 1811 a new
and very stringent Statute was enacted, which required every Fellow on his election to swear that
he was then unmarried, and that, should he marry at any time of his tenure of Fellowship, he
would within three months inform the Provost. This practically required all future married
Fellows to resign. An exception, however, was made in favour of the existing Fellows, whether
married or not in 1811. The Celibacy Statute, as it was called, remained in force until 1840,
when it was repealed, and all restrictions upon marriage removed. This repeal was not effected
without considerable agitation, which commenced in 1836. The value of the benefices in the gift
of the College had fallen at least twenty-five per cent., in consequence of the commutation of
tithe payable by the occupier of land into a rent charge payable by his landlord. In the greater
part of the South of Ireland where the anti-tithe war had raged, and where the clergy had found
it impossible to collect the revenues of their benefices, the change was decidedly advantageous.
In the North of Ireland, however, where the College livings lay, no such resistance to the
payment of tithes had been experienced, and consequently the change was a loss to the clergy.
This, added to the poor’s rate, which was then introduced, and the ecclesiastical tax upon livings,
which was at that time first imposed, had so greatly reduced the value of the College benefices,
that many of them failed to attract the Fellows. In addition to this, the income of the Junior
Fellows had become more equable and more certain, and their labours had diminished in consequence
of the change which was effected by the adoption of a division of tutorial fees and of
tutorial lectures in 1835; consequently few of the Junior Fellows were disposed to change an
agreeable literary life in Dublin for a retirement in the country, even though they should be thus
enabled to marry.</p>

<p>In February, 1836, the Provost and Senior Fellows, two only dissenting, agreed to join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Junior Fellows in an application to the Lord Lieutenant for a repeal of the obnoxious Statute,
suggesting, however, that the six most Junior of the Fellows should be exempted from the
permission to marry. The Earl of Mulgrave, then Viceroy, declined to recommend the change.
At the end of 1838 a further memorial was presented to the representative of the Crown, praying
that the Fellows above the lower nine of the body should be allowed to marry. The Provost
and Senior Fellows concurred in the prayer of the memorial, stipulating, however, that the plan
should be accompanied by such measures as would prevent the College livings from being
declined by the whole body of Fellows. On the arrival of a new Viceroy (Lord Fortescue) in
1839, a memorial was presented to him by the College asking for a repeal of the Celibacy Statute.
To this there was a considerable opposition on the part of the great body of the Scholars and
prospective Fellowship candidates, on the ground that the existing Fellows would be settled for
life in the College, and the vacancies for fresh elections would become very rare, and thus the
highest mathematical and literary studies in the College would suffer. It was known, also, that
the Archbishop of Armagh, Lord John George Beresford, who was then Vice-Chancellor, and who
took a warm interest in the welfare of the College, was strongly opposed to the repeal of this
Statute. In the end the Government was guided by the advice of Dr. Dickinson, afterwards
Bishop of Meath, and in 1840 the Celibacy Statute was repealed; ten new Fellowships were
added, one to be elected each year; the six junior of the Fellows were excluded from the
emoluments of the tutors, and restricted to the statutable emoluments of a Junior Fellow (about
£37 a-year, with rooms and dinner in the Hall); and the number of Tutor Fellows was
increased from fifteen to nineteen, the average income of the tutors being thus diminished
by 21 per cent.</p>

<p>It could scarcely be expected that an institution like Trinity College, which at that time
had many political enemies, should escape a searching inquiry at the hands of a Royal Commission;
and accordingly, in April, 1851, a full and minute investigation was made into the
working of the College, the Commissioners being Archbishop Whately, Lord Chancellor Brady,
the Earl of Rosse, the Bishop of Cork, Doctor Mountiford Longfield, and Edward J. Cooper,
Esq. The Commissioners reported in April, 1853, and in a manner highly favourable to the
College. They found “that numerous improvements of an important character have been from
time to time introduced by the authorities of the College, and that the general state of the
College is satisfactory. There is great activity and efficiency in the different departments, and
the spirit of improvement has been especially shown in the changes which have been introduced
in the course of education, to adapt it to the requirements of the age.” They ended in recommending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
some twenty-five changes. But they took care to add that these recommendations did
not involve any great or fundamental alteration in the arrangements of the University, or in the
system of education pursued in it. “From its present state,” they add, “and from what has
already been effected by the authorities of the College, we do not believe such changes to be
required.”</p>

<p>Most of these recommendations have since that time been carried out by Royal Statutes,
which were obtained at the request of the Provost and Senior Fellows, and in the application for
which they were strengthened by the report of the Commissioners. 1. The Statutes underwent
a complete revision. 2. Senior Fellows ceased to hold Professorships. 3. The Board obtained
power to vary, with the consent of the Visitors, the subjects prescribed for the Fellowship
Examinations, and to regulate the mode in which the Examination should be conducted, so that
any Junior Fellow who holds a Professorship may now be summoned to examine in the subject
of his Professorship. 4. Each vacancy for Fellowship or Scholarship is now filled by a separate
vote of the electors, and the successful candidates are placed in the order of merit. 5. The fees
payable to the tutors are no longer divided irrespectively of the number of pupils of each tutor,
but a proportion of the fees paid by each student is paid directly to his College tutor, and the
remainder paid into a common fund, from which certain Professorships are endowed, which are
tenable by Junior Fellows alone. 6. The general obligation to take Holy Orders is no longer
imposed on the Fellows, the number of Lay Fellows being at first increased from three to five.
7. Ex-Fellows are now eligible for the Regius Professorship of Divinity. 8. The Professors of
Modern Languages are now elected as other Professors, and these languages may now be selected
by students of the Sophister Classes and for the B.A. degree in lieu of Greek and Latin. 9. The
Board and Visitors have now the power of altering the subjects for the Scholarship Examination,
and by a recent Statute the tenure of the Scholarship has been limited to five years. 10. Twenty
Senior and twenty Junior Exhibitions of £25 each tenable for two years have been founded, and
they are open to students without respect to creed. 11. No distinction is now made between
Pensioners, Fellow Commoners, and Noblemen as to the course of education required for the
B.A. degree. 12. The formal exercises then required for the different degrees have been discontinued,
and (except the M.A. degree) all the higher degrees have been made real tests of
merit. 13. Full power to admit readers to the College Library has been conferred upon the
Provost and Senior Fellows. 14. An auditor of the College is now appointed by the Visitors,
and an audited balance sheet and account of income and expenditure is annually presented to
them, and is open to the inspection of all members of the Corporation. 15. The Bursar is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
paid by salary and not by fees, and local land agents have been appointed in cases in which the
occupying tenants hold directly from the College. 16. The College officers formerly paid by
fees are now paid by salaries in proportion to the services performed by them. 17. There has
been a gradual reduction in the number of Non-Tutor Fellows created by the Statute of 1840.
These form the great majority of the recommendations of the Royal Commissioners.</p>

<p>In addition to these alterations some considerable improvements were effected by the
Royal Statute of the 18th Victoria. The whole of the College Statutes were carefully revised,
and the obsolete and injurious enactments were repealed. The power of assigning or of transferring
pupils from one tutor to another, which Provost Hutchinson attempted to exercise in an
arbitrary manner, was removed from the Provost and vested in the Board; and to the Board, with
the consent of the Visitors, was given the power, which they had not before, of founding new
Professorships and offices, and of assigning salaries to be paid to them from the revenues of the
College.</p>

<p>Immediately after these powers had been granted by Letters Patent, the Board and
Visitors acted in conformity with their new authority. In 1855 a decree was passed dividing the
subjects of the Fellowship Examination into four&mdash;Mathematics, Classics (including Hebrew),
Mental and Moral Sciences, and Experimental Physics; the time for the examination was
greatly extended. Science scholarships were founded, and the number of days of examination,
both for classical and science scholarships, increased; and in the same year a similar decree
regulated the salary and duties of the Regius Professor of Greek, and founded new Professorships
of Arabic and of English Literature. In 1856 certain salaries of College officers were fixed, and the
salaries of the Professor of Geology and of Erasmus Smith’s Professor of Natural Philosophy
(when held by a Junior Fellow) were regulated. In 1858 a decree was passed which transferred
all fees hitherto payable to College officers to the general funds of the College, and assigned fixed
salaries in lieu of them. Two Senior Tutorships, each with a salary of £800, were founded; the
salary of the Examinerships held by Non-Tutor Fellows was raised to £100 per annum;
Classical Honour Lectureships were instituted, and a Professorship of Sanscrit and Comparative
Philology. In 1862 two Professorships of Modern Languages were established, the salaries of
the holders being paid out of the funds of the College&mdash;the Act of Parliament 18 and 19 Victoria,
cap. 82, having deprived the College of two annual sums of £92 6s. 2d. each, which had been
granted by the 41 George III., cap. 32, out of the Consolidated Fund for this purpose. The same
Act dispossessed the College of its earliest, and only, subvention from the State, which was
granted by Queen Elizabeth&mdash;an annual charge of £358 16s. on the revenues of Ireland; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
grounds assigned for this deprivation being the removal of the stamp duties on Degrees,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> which
had been imposed on the College only thirteen years before. These duties (which have long
since been abolished in England) were £1 on matriculation, £3 for the degree of B.A., and
£6 for any other degree.</p>

<p>The University&mdash;consisting of the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor, Doctors in the several
faculties, and Masters of Arts&mdash;having been governed for more than two hundred years by certain
rules or Statutes which had, by lapse of time, become in many respects obsolete and unsuited to
the present state of the University, and doubts having been raised as to whether the Provost and
Senior Fellows of the College had the power to alter or amend these rules, Letters Patent were
asked for and granted by the Crown (July 24, 1857), confirming all former powers, usages, and
privileges, giving the Board power to make laws concerning the conferring of Degrees, provided
that such laws should be afterwards confirmed by the University Senate, enacting that no “grace”
should be proposed to that body which had not been first adopted by the Board; incorporating
the University Senate under the name of the Chancellor, Masters, and Doctors of the University
of Dublin, and giving the Senate power to elect the Chancellor from three names to be submitted
to them by the Board, who relinquished their old right in this respect. Further Letters Patent
were obtained in 1858, which enabled the Board to commute the fees of certain offices for lesser
salaries, and to forego fees hitherto payable to them for Degrees which were in future to be applied
to the benefit of the College; and out of the funds so transferred fourteen Studentships were
founded, at a salary of £100 per annum for each, tenable for seven years, to be given every year at
the Degree Examination; two new offices (Senior Tutorships), to be held by Junior Fellows, were
created; two of the Non-Tutor Fellowships were merged among the Tutor Fellowships, and the
remaining four were gradually discontinued. The Board was given power to sanction new rules
for the distribution of the tutorial fees, and a clause was added enabling candidates for Fellowships
to attend only on the days on which the courses in which they compete are examined in,
and giving other powers to the Board.</p>

<p>In conformity with the powers granted to the Board by the Letters Patent of 1857, in
December of the following year they remodelled, with the approval of the Senate, all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
University rules with respect to Degrees. Further Letters Patent were obtained in 1865,
rectifying defects in the existing Statutes, specially with respect to the examination for
Fellowships, and in 1868 for the creation of a Regius Professor of Surgery. In 1870 the Provost
and Senior Fellows founded a Professor of Latin, under the same regulations which prevailed
with regard to the Professor of Greek; and at the same time they founded forty Exhibitions of
£25 each, tenable for two years, twenty Senior and twenty Junior, to aid deserving students in
the prosecution of their undergraduate course. In 1871 the Professorships of Ancient History
and of Zoology were founded, and in 1872 a Professorship of Comparative Anatomy.</p>

<p>The Act of Parliament amending the law with regard to promissory oaths, and that of
1873 abolishing religious tests in the University of Dublin, necessitated further changes in the
Royal Statutes of the College, and these were effected by Letters Patent of 1874, which also
founded the Academic Council, and transferred to it, from the Provost and Senior Fellows, the
nomination to Professorships, and gave to it, concurrently with the Board, the power to regulate
the studies of the College.</p>

<p>This Council consists of sixteen members and the Provost&mdash;four elected by the Senior
Fellows, four by the Junior, four by the Professors who are not Fellows, and four by the Senate
at large (excluding those who are already represented). The representatives of each class hold
office for four years, are elected at the same time, and vacate office in rotation. The electors can
give all their votes to one candidate, or they may distribute them among the candidates as they
think fit. The election to Professorships in the Divinity School, of Medical Professors founded
by Act of Parliament, and of Professors of private foundation the appointment of which is by
the wills of the founders vested in the Provost and Senior Fellows, remains with the Board.</p>

<p>In 1851 a very important Act of Parliament was passed, which extended the leasing
powers of the College in respect to the estates belonging to the Corporation. Prior to that year
it was precluded from giving leases of the lands belonging to the College for a longer period
than twenty-one years, except in cities, where sites for building might be leased for forty years.
The rent to be reserved should be equal to one-half of the true value of the lands, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">communibus
annis</i>, at the time of making the lease. The Provost and Senior Fellows, however, might grant
leases for twenty-one years at a rent equal to that which was hitherto payable out of the lands,
even though it was less than half the value. The custom was for the College to renew these
leases when a few years had expired, on the payment of fines which were in some cases
considerable, and which were divided among the members of the Governing Body of the College.
These renewal fines formed the principal part of the incomes of the Senior Fellows. By the Act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of 1851 (14 and 15 Victoria, cap. 128) additional powers of leasing were granted up to ninety-nine
years without fines, reserving a minimum rent of three-fourths of the annual value; making,
however, a reduction in respect to the tenant’s interest in an unexpired lease when it was
surrendered. Also, powers of granting leases in perpetuity were given to the Board on the
surrender by the tenants of the existing leases. These perpetuity rents were fixed by a regulation
contained in the Statute, and were variable from time to time, at intervals of ten years,
according to the changes in the prices of certain agricultural commodities. Renewal fines were
abolished, and the Provost and Senior Fellows were compensated for the loss of them by a fixed
annual sum of £800 paid to each of them out of the revenues of the College. Consequent upon
the changes which have been indicated above, the Senior Fellows relinquished their claims to an
annual sum, which, according to the Report of the University Commissioners, amounted to about
£2,650, their official salaries being now fixed at sums according to the duties of the office; and, on
the whole, the income of each Senior Fellow is on the average about £363 less than it was in
1851. The difference has been employed in the foundation of Studentships and Exhibitions,
the annual charge for which is about £2,000.</p>

<p>The most serious danger with which Trinity College has been threatened during the
present century arose from an attempt which the Government of the day made in 1873 to
deprive it of its University powers, and of a large portion of its endowments. A Bill was
introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Gladstone for the purpose of establishing one
University in Ireland, and an essential part of its proposals was that Trinity College should
cease to be the University of Dublin, and that another Mixed Body should take its place. That
the power of conferring Degrees and regulating Professorships in this University, and of
appointing and dismissing the Professors, should be vested in a Council of twenty-eight
members, of which Trinity College should have the power of nominating only two. It proposed
that there should be a number of affiliated Colleges in the country, and that they too should be
represented on this Council, so that a College able to matriculate fifty students should send one
representative, and a College able to matriculate one hundred and fifty should send two members,
and that no College, however numerous its students, should be represented by a larger
number of members. It was, moreover, another essential part of this measure, that neither
Mental and Moral Science nor History should form any part of the Professorial instruction or of
the University Examinations. In order to assist in making up an endowment of £50,000 per
annum for the purposes of this University, it was proposed to suppress Queen’s College, Galway,
and allocate the £10,000 a-year of its endowment; to put a charge of £12,000 annually on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the estates of Trinity College; and to transfer, moreover, the Degree fees, which are now paid
into the general funds of this College, to the Governing Body of the new University. The
buildings, the library, and the remainder of the endowments were to belong to the College,
which in other respects should remain, as at present, as a teaching institution.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that this Bill, if carried into a law, would have ruined Trinity
College. A large number of its students would have been withdrawn, for they could have
the prestige of the Degree of the University of Dublin without being members of the
College, and the fees which they at present pay to the support of the College and its
teachers would have been no longer available. It is not too much to assert that the College
would have lost 33 per cent. of its available revenue, and that it would have been impossible
to maintain it on the income which remained.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the College, the Roman Catholic Bishops opposed the plan of the
Government, which did not include the endowment of a Roman Catholic College, and which
did not meet their demand for a Roman Catholic University. After a debate lasting for four
nights, the Government proposal was rejected on the 11th of March, 1873, by a majority
of three.</p>

<p>There were two important occasions upon which entertainments on a scale of
considerable grandeur were given during the present century in the Hall of Trinity College.
The first was in 1821, on the occasion of the visit of George the Fourth to Ireland, when
the King honoured the College with his presence at a great banquet. His Majesty was
received in the Library, where addresses were presented to him, and after receiving them
most graciously he was conducted through a passage made for the occasion into the
Examination Hall, where were collected at dinner a considerable number of the Irish
nobility, the Bishops of the Irish Church, the Judges, and many of the most influential
persons in the country, along with the distinguished suite which attended the King.</p>

<p>His Majesty afterwards expressed himself as much gratified by the reception which
he met with in the College. On this occasion the scholars were entertained at the same
time in the Dining Hall, under the presidency of Dr. Sadlier, then a Junior Fellow, and
afterwards Provost. It was in connection with this visit of the King that the University
of Dublin asserted and secured its right of precedency after the Corporation of the City.</p>

<p>The second occasion was in August, 1835, when the British Association made its
first visit to Dublin; Dr. Bartholomew Lloyd, then Provost, was the President of the
Association, and some of the leading scientific men of England and of the Continent were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
present. A considerable number of these were accommodated during the meeting with
chambers in the College, and had their breakfasts and dinners in the Hall. A great
banquet was, moreover, given to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (the Earl of Mulgrave), and
to about 300 members of the Association, in the Examination Hall. The guests assembled
before dinner in the College Library, and His Excellency took the opportunity of conferring
the honour of Knighthood upon the Professor of Astronomy, William Rowan Hamilton.
This was the first instance in which an Irish Viceroy had so honoured an individual for
eminent scientific merit. At the dinner which followed, Professor Whewell of Cambridge
remarked in his speech that it was then just one hundred and thirty-six years since a
great man in another University knelt down before his Sovereign and rose up Sir Isaac
Newton. Among the foreign visitors were De Toqueville, Montalembert, Barclay de Tolly,
L. Agassiz, and many others.</p>

<p>The general history of Trinity College during the nineteenth century would be incomplete
if some reference were not made to a matter which elicited considerable public feeling at
the time, but which is now almost forgotten. On the 12th of March, 1858, the Earl of
Eglinton, who had been very popular as Viceroy of Ireland on a previous occasion, returned
as Lord Lieutenant on a change of Ministry. It was quite a holiday in Dublin. Several
hundreds of the students had assembled within the enclosed space in front of the College
(which was at that time larger than it is now), and had crowded out into the street, for the
purpose of witnessing the procession in its progress up College Green and Dame Street to
the Castle. For some time previous to the approach of the Lord Lieutenant, they amused
themselves by letting off squibs and crackers, and by throwing orange peel and other similar
missiles at the crowd outside, as well as at the police. The Junior Dean, apprehending
some ill results if the disposition and temper of the students were misunderstood by the
people and by the police, went out amongst them, and begged that they would not resent
these demonstrations on the part of the students. No political display was intended by them,
and consequently if good humour were preserved on both sides all would pass off quietly.
Colonel Browne, who was in command of the police, on two or three occasions went inside
the railings to reason with the students; his reception on each occasion was courteous, and
he was cheered by the College men. From the period when the Viceregal procession came
in sight, there was a suspension of the bombardment from within the College rails. As the
Lord Lieutenant passed by, there was very little political manifestation by the students.
After the procession had passed, those within the railings commenced again to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
crackers, squibs, and oranges, and the confusion increased. Colonel Browne rode up, and
in vain endeavoured to be heard. He was struck in the face by an orange, amidst a shout
of laughter from the students and from the crowds in the street. At this time he seemed
to lose his temper, and went to Colonel Griffiths commanding the Scots Greys, who were
posted near the Bank of Ireland, and asked him to charge. Colonel Griffiths laughed, and
asked whom he was to charge&mdash;was it a parcel of schoolboys? Colonel Browne then
brought a party of the mounted police in front of the soldiers, and drew up immediately
in their rear a body of the foot police, with their batons in their hands. At this juncture
the Junior Dean, foreseeing that something serious was likely to ensue if the students did
not at once disperse, called on such of them as were outside the College railings to come
within the College gate, and he succeeded in getting a considerable number of them inside
the College, and had the gates closed. Many of the students, however, were unable to get
inside&mdash;some were with the Junior Dean inside the railings and some in the street.
Immediately after this Colonel Browne ordered the mounted police to Charge. The outer
gates of the enclosure were forced open; the police, mounted as well as on foot, at once
rushed on the students within the railings (the statues of Burke and Goldsmith had not at
that time been erected); they cut at them with their sabres, rode over them, and the unmounted
men used their batons in every direction and indiscriminately as regarded the persons with
whom they came in contact. The students had no means of defending themselves, the
Junior Dean having early in the proceedings induced them to give up to him the sticks
which they carried. Several of them were struck down, and deliberately batoned again
and again while on the ground by the foot police in a most inhuman manner. The Junior
Dean then went outside the railings, and, addressing Colonel Browne, said that he would
engage to withdraw the students if the Colonel would withdraw the police. This was
assented to, but the foot police for a considerable time waited within the enclosure. So great
was the violence of the assault of the mounted men that, in following the students who
rushed into the College through the open wicket gate, they used their swords with such
vigour against the wooden gate that it showed several marks of their sabres, large pieces
being cut off in some places. Among the students whose lives were endangered by the
onslaught of the police were Mr. Leeson, Mr. J. W. Gregg, Mr. Pollock, Mr. Fuller, Mr.
Leathem, Mr. Brownrigg, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lyndsay, and Mr. Chadwick. Some of them
suffered very severe injuries. Mr. Clarke was wounded in the back with a sabre cut while
he was stretched on the ground from the blow of a baton. The College authorities prosecuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Colonel Browne and some of the police criminally for an assault on the students, but they
were acquitted by a jury at the ensuing Commission. It is pleasing to add that since that
time the best relations have existed between the students and the Metropolitan police;
indeed, the feelings of the latter body were supposed at the time to have been excited by
some strong observations which were made in the columns of a Dublin newspaper which
appeared on the morning of the occurrence.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">The Divinity School of Trinity College.</span>&mdash;The institution of a special school
designed for the instruction of the future clergy of the Church of Ireland did not take effect
until the close of the eighteenth century. The students of Trinity College, under instruction,
were at the beginning of this century either undergraduates or Bachelors of Arts. The
undergraduates were lectured in classics and mathematics by public lecturers appointed by
the College, and their religious training was specially entrusted to the Catechist. After
they took the B.A. degree they still continued under instruction by the several Professors
of the mathematical and physical sciences, of Greek, and of the several faculties, while their
religious instruction was under the special care of the Regius Professor of Divinity, and
of a Lecturer of early but uncertain foundation, which latter post was afterwards endowed
with the interest of £1,000 by Archbishop King. Junior Bachelors attended the prelections
of this Lecturer, and Middle and Senior Bachelors the prelections of the Regius Professor;
and this attendance was compulsory upon all graduates in residence. Many ex-Scholars of
Trinity College remember well that until recent times all Scholars who were graduates
were obliged to attend, at their choice, certain courses of lectures with the Professors of
Greek or Oratory or Mathematics or Law, but all were, without distinction, under pain of
losing their salaries, obliged to attend lectures with either the Regius Professor of Divinity
or Archbishop King’s Lecturer. In the year 1790, at a meeting of the Irish Bishops,
it was determined that they would in future not ordain any candidate who had not the B.A.
degree and a certificate of having attended lectures in Divinity for one academic year (at
that time consisting of four terms), and they forwarded to the Board a list of books in
which the Bishops had decided that candidates for Holy Orders should be examined prior
to ordination. The Board, in reply, informed the Bishops that they would direct the
assistant to Archbishop King’s Lecturer to prepare the students in these books. From
1790 to 1833 Divinity students attended the lectures of the assistants to Archbishop King’s
Lecturer (the Regius Professor had not at that time any assistants) on two days in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, from eight to nine in the morning. They were put through
Burnet on the Thirty-nine Articles, and if any student attended three-fourths<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> of the lectures
in each of the four terms of the Junior Bachelor year he received a certificate, which was
inserted in the testimonium of his degree, and on this he was entitled to present himself for
the Ordination Examination. The Rev. Richard Brooke, in his <em>Recollections of the Irish
Church</em>, gives a very vivid account of his experience as a Divinity student in 1827. The books
he then read&mdash;they could not have been all lectured on (and there is no record of any compulsory
Divinity examination)&mdash;were Burnet, Pearson, Mosheim, Paley’s Evidences, Magee on the
Atonement, Wheatley on the Common Prayer, Tomline on the Articles, Butler’s Analogy, and
the Bible and Greek Testament, with Patrick Lowth and Whitby’s Commentary. It is believed,
from the testimony of clergymen who were students at that period, that the lectures were
confined very much to Burnet and Butler.</p>

<p>At that time, Archbishop King’s Lecturer in Divinity was an annual office poorly endowed,
and, like the Professorships of Greek, of Mathematics, and of Civil Law, held always by a
Senior Fellow. Such was the condition of things up to 1833. The Divinity Professors were
mainly engaged in prelecting to graduate Scholars, and to such graduates as desired to attend their
lectures. In that year the Divinity School was arranged upon its present basis. Dr. Elrington
was, in 1833, Regius Professor of Divinity; and the annual office of Archbishop King’s Lecturer
was separated from a Senior Fellowship, was endowed with £700 a-year from the funds of the
College, and was given to Dr. O’Brien, afterwards Bishop of Ossory, but at that time a Junior
Fellow, as a permanent Professorship. The course was extended to one of two years’ length,
compulsory examinations were instituted, assistants to the Regius Professor were then first
appointed, and he and they had the care of the Senior class, consisting only of those who had
passed the B.A. examination. Archbishop King’s Lecturer and his assistants had the instruction
of the Junior class of Divinity students entrusted to them. These were for the most part Senior
Sophisters.</p>

<p>The Divinity course now comprises two years’ study of Divinity, each consisting of three
academic terms. Students generally begin to attend lectures at the beginning of their third
year in Arts. In the Junior year they are lectured by Archbishop King’s Lecturer on the
Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion, and in the Socinian Controversy; and by his
assistants in the Greek of the Gospels and of the Epistle to the Romans, and in Pearson on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Creed. There are three days set apart for composition of sermons and essays each term, when
the students are brought into the Hall, and are given either a text of Scripture, or a subject
connected with the Professor’s lectures for that term, to write upon; two such compositions at
least, in each term, are obligatory. During the Christmas and Easter recesses the students are
obliged to study one of the Epistles in Greek, and a portion of Ecclesiastical History, in
which they are examined on the first lecture-day of the following term. Having completed
three terms’ lectures, they pass an examination in certain text-books connected with the
studies of the Junior year, and in the English New Testament; in specified portions of the Greek
Testament, and in the Professor’s prelections. Having passed this examination, they are
permitted to attend the lectures of the Regius Professor of Divinity and his assistants for the
next three terms. The lectures of the Regius Professor are upon the Book of Common Prayer,
the Canon of Holy Scripture, and the Roman Catholic Controversy; and his assistants lecture
upon Bishops Burnet and Browne on the Thirty-nine Articles, and upon the Greek of the Second
Epistle to the Corinthians and the Epistle to the Hebrews. The rules with regard to study in
the intervals between the terms and composition are nearly the same as those of the Junior
year; and when the student has completed his sixth term of study, he presents himself at the
examination for the Divinity Testimonium, after he has, in nearly every case, taken his B.A.
degree. Lectures in Ecclesiastical History, in Hebrew, in Pastoral Theology, and in Biblical
Greek are provided, but they are not compulsory. The number of Divinity Testimoniums
granted for each of the last five years averaged 35, and for each of the previous five years
the average was 32.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The subjects of the Divinity lectures for the Junior year were arranged in reference to the
controversies which were most prevalent in the Irish Church in the year 1833, and also in reference
to the special theological aptitudes of Dr. O’Brien. He was peculiarly fitted to treat of the
evidences of natural and revealed religion, and to reply to the objections to both which were
then current. Those who remember his prelections can bear testimony to the wonderful ability
and skill with which he dealt with the infidel controversy of his time, and the light which he
threw upon the well-known arguments of Bishop Butler. The Socinian controversy at that
period occupied the serious attention of the Irish clergy, and it was necessary that all the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
ministers of the Church should be prepared to deal with the arguments of the Unitarian when
they entered upon their duties as curates.</p>

<p>Prior to 1814 the Regius Professor of Divinity held no public examination in the subjects
of his course. In 1813 Dean Graves, who at that time held the office, submitted to the Board a
plan for the improvement of Divinity lectures, and a new Royal Statute was obtained regulating
the duties of the Professor. He was bound to deliver prelections during term, but they were
practically confined to the first week in Michaelmas term, the first and second weeks in Hilary
term, and the first week in Easter term. He was also bound to hold an examination once a-year,
open to Bachelors of Arts. The subjects of this examination were fixed by Statute. On the
first morning it was the Old Testament, the first afternoon the New; on the second morning
in Ecclesiastical History, and the second afternoon in the Articles and Liturgy of the Church of
England. In 1814 the Board instituted prizes at this examination, which was otherwise voluntary.
On the first occasion thirty graduates entered their names for the examination, but only
five attended, and it ended in only three or four highly prepared Divinity students presenting
themselves each year for a searching examination in an extended course. In 1859 these Divinity
prizes were enlarged into Theological Exhibitions, two of which, of £60 and £40 a-year, tenable
for three years, are now awarded as the result of this examination, greatly enlarged and extended
by the addition of selections from the writings of the Fathers and specified portions of the
Hebrew text of the Old Testament. Prizes also at the end of the first Divinity year, called after
the name of Archbishop King, were founded in 1836. Both these stimulants to theological study,
aided by annual prizes at examinations held by the Professors of Biblical Greek and of
Ecclesiastical History, have very widely extended the reading of the best class of Divinity
students. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity are now required to pass an
examination in the whole of the extended range of theological subjects required of candidates
for the Exhibitions; but as those who seek Divinity degrees are generally clergymen who are
engaged in the duties of their calling, they are allowed to divide the examination into parts and
to pass it in detail instead of on one occasion. Few of the modern arrangements have been so
successful as this. By directing and encouraging a wide course of theological reading among the
younger clergy, it has produced an excellent effect, and the popularity of the arrangement is
manifested by the large increase in the number of candidates for the B.D. degree by examination.</p>

<p>It would give an incomplete account of the preparation of candidates for Holy Orders in
Trinity College, Dublin, if we were to omit the mention of the important training which the
College Theological Society affords to the students. Once in each week during term the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
members meet under the presidency of either the Regius Professor or of Archbishop King’s
Lecturer in Divinity; essays on theological subjects, or on one of the important religious
questions of the day, are read by the students in turn; a debate upon the essay follows, which is
watched over and moderated by the President, who, at the conclusion, makes such observations
as he thinks fit. The students are in this manner practised in thoughtful and carefully prepared
composition, and in extempore speaking; and the great benefits derived by Divinity students
from this voluntary society are universally admitted&mdash;advantages which have been mainly due to
the unremitting care of the late Bishop Butcher, formerly Regius Professor, and his successors

<p><span class="smcap">The Medical School.</span>&mdash;The marked and rapid growth of the Medical School of the
University of Dublin has been one of the most notable events in its history during the nineteenth
century. Although it was in existence in Trinity College since 1711, it was only in 1786 that it
was placed on its present footing by an Act of the Irish Parliament, which united the College of
Physicians with Trinity College in the joint management of the instruction given in this school.
Five of the teachers are appointed by the Provost and Senior Fellows, and four (designated
King’s Professors) by the College of Physicians, the Trustees of Sir Patrick Dun’s estates. This
Statute further required that all who shall be in attendance on medical lectures, whether students
of Trinity College or extern students in Medicine, shall be matriculated by the Senior Lecturer.</p>

<p>For the first fifteen years these matriculations averaged only 4·7 each year. The numbers
gradually increased, until in the years 1809-1813, inclusive, the average reached 41·4 each year;
from 1814 to 1824 they rose to an average of 66·5. In the next quinquennial period they
increased to the large number of 90·8 annually. In the years from 1831 to 1835 the average fell
to 63, and in the following two years the number barely exceeded 28 each year. The great
increase of medical students in the period between 1814 and 1835 is to be attributed mainly to
the eminence of the University Professor of Anatomy and Chirurgery&mdash;James Macartney<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
man of the greatest powers both as an anatomist, a biologist, and surgical teacher. On his ceasing
to hold the Professorship, the number of students in the Medical School fell to what it had been
before his appointment; and having continued at a low level for thirty years, it suddenly rose to
an average of nearly 80 entrances in 1864, in which year Doctor Edward H. Bennett, the present
Professor of Surgery, was appointed to the office of University Anatomist&mdash;an office which had,
after being in abeyance for a century, been revived in 1861. From this time the numbers have
gradually risen until they amounted to more than they were in the most flourishing period of
Doctor Macartney’s teaching. Doctor Macartney held the Chair of Anatomy for twenty-four
years, until July, 1837, when he resigned the office, very much because he was unwilling to submit
to the rules laid down by the governing body of the College. In the year 1834 a complaint was
made to the Provost and Senior Fellows, by the other Professors of the Medical School, that he
had fixed his lectures at an hour, from 3 to 4 p.m., which interfered with those of the other
Professors of that school. In December, 1835, the Board informed him that they would permit
him to continue his lectures during that session at the hour which he had announced, but that
this privilege would not be further continued. In November, 1836, Dr. Macartney persisted in
lecturing at 3 o’clock. He was ordered by the Board to lecture at another hour, and this
order was conveyed also to the College of Physicians. Dr. Macartney persisted; and the Board
took the advice of counsel as to their powers, and, as a result, they ordered the Anatomy House
to be closed from 3 to 4 o’clock. In the end the Professor yielded. But another cause of dispute
soon rose. In April, 1836, the Board received a letter from the Registrar of the School of Physic,
which stated that Doctor Macartney wished to have his lectures advertised as being two in
Anatomy and two in Surgery each week. This was held by the Board to be insufficient, inasmuch
as the University of Edinburgh required five lectures in each of these subjects every week, and
would require from the Dublin Professors certificates to that effect. Notwithstanding the
remonstrance of the Provost and Senior Fellows, Doctor Macartney persisted in his advertisement.
Doctor Sandes, one of the Senior Fellows, undertook at their request to write to the
Professor in the hope that he would be able to induce him to change his decision, but his attempt
was not followed by success. A case was laid before Mr. Pennefather, K.C., and as a result of
his opinion, on November 26, 1836, Doctor Macartney was required to deliver five lectures in each
week at one o’clock during the session. On July 13, 1837, he resigned the Professorship&mdash;four
years before his tenure of office would otherwise have expired.</p>

<p>In consequence of his quarrel with the authorities of Trinity College, all Doctor
Macartney’s valuable collection of preparations became the property of the University of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Cambridge. That learned body agreed with Macartney that he should transfer his collections
to them in consideration of an annuity of £100 for a period not exceeding ten years. In
making arrangements with Doctor Harrison, his successor, the Board took care to renew the
understanding which they had made in 1802 with Dr. Hartigan, but which they had, through
an oversight, omitted to establish on Doctor Macartney’s election&mdash;that all such preparations
should become the property of the College.</p>

<p>It should be added, in justice to Dr. Harrison, who succeeded Macartney, and who was
an excellent human anatomist and a most painstaking and attractive lecturer, that the great
falling off of medical students in his time must be attributed to many causes beyond his
control: first, the refusal of the Irish College of Surgeons to receive certificates of his
lectures, very much through professional jealousy; secondly, the opening of large medical
schools in the central parts of England, which drew away all the Welsh students who had
before that time come to Dublin in considerable numbers, and the opening of the Ledwich School
of Medicine in Dublin; and thirdly, to the institution of the Queen’s Colleges in Belfast,
Cork, and Galway, which retained in those towns the students in Medicine who had previously
been in the habit of coming to Dublin for lectures.</p>

<p>The old Anatomy House, situated between the College Park and the Fellows’ Garden, was
a small and inconvenient building. It became altogether unsuited to the numbers attending
Doctor Macartney’s classes. In 1815 space was made for them by the removal of the wax
models from the room in which they had been placed to that over it, and a small building was
erected in the Fellows’ Garden adjacent to the old house. This was but a temporary expedient,
for we find that in 1820 the floor of the lecture-room was reported to be in a dangerous condition,
and the Board directed that, in future, lectures in Anatomy and Chemistry should be delivered in
the public lecture-room in No. 22 of the Library Square. A committee was appointed to arrange
for a new site for the Medical School. That which was at first fixed upon was at the east side
of the Fellows’ Garden, between the old Anatomy House and Nassau Street; but on further
consideration it was changed to the ground, hitherto the Bowling Green, at the remote extremity
of the College Park. On April 1, 1823, estimates were laid before the Board for the building of
an anatomical and chemical theatre on the above site. The estimates ranged between £3,980
and £5,350, and a contract was made for the work. Macartney seems to have taken a great
interest in the selecting of the site. Thus we find him writing to the Registrar, Dr. Phipps,
from Newry, in May, 1822:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As our interest, and that of our successors, and the future prosperity of the Medical School, will be affected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
by the situation and mode of erecting of the building intended for the Anatomical and Chemical instruction, we
beg leave to lay our opinions before the Board on this subject. (1.) With respect to situation, we consider any part of
that side of the Park next Nassau Street as being eligible, but if we were to select a particular place on this line it
would be opposite to Kildare Street, showing the front towards the street. The Bowling Green we think a
disadvantageous situation, as being damp, and the entrance being through a private yard, which has been proposed
by the architect, we think would be highly injurious to the respectability of the School. The distance of the
Bowling Green would be very inconvenient to students in Arts, of whom our classes are chiefly composed. The
above objection equally applies to the side of the Park next Brunswick Street. (2.) We are of opinion that, to
make the buildings distinct, however contiguous in situation to each other, would much facilitate and simplify the
plans, and expedite their erection, and would add greatly to the respectability of both establishments; as the shape
and disposition of the apartments in the two houses might be different, we are satisfied that less expense would be
incurred by adopting a separate plan for each house.”</p></div>

<p class="noindent">And while the building was being erected he wrote about the light, sending the following
characteristic letter to the Board (29th March, 1823):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The light we want in the lecture-room may still be had without displacing a single timber of the roof as
it at present stands, but after the copper is put on, any change will be attended with delay and expense, and I am
satisfied that the Board (if not now) will hereafter be disposed to yield to the just complaints of the pupils with
respect to the want of light. I think it will be generally acknowledged that, after the experience of teaching in
different lecture-rooms for twenty-five years, my opinion ought to have more weight than that of any architect. I
wish to add that I have no direct interest in the matter; whether there be good or bad light would not increase or
diminish my class, as is fully proved by the number of pupils who attend in my present room, where one half of
the objects used at lecture cannot be seen for the want of light, and where, from want of space, some are obliged to
stand in the lobby; but I should think myself deficient in public duty if I did not persist in stating to the Board
the inconvenience and injury that will be sustained by the pupils, of what they have now for several years
anticipated the removal, by the erection of a suitable building for carrying on the business of the School.”</p></div>

<p class="noindent">These Medical School buildings were in use from 1825 for more than fifty years. When
of late years the number of medical students increased so largely, and it was found that
this latter building was altogether unsuited for the modern requirements of the school, the
present chemical laboratory and dissecting-room were erected, and a histological laboratory
and physiological lecture-room were added. In 1884 a bone-room, a preparation room,
and private laboratories were built. In the same year the new chemical theatre was opened,
and in the following year the new anatomical theatre was completed, which is fitted for a
class of 230 students. Since that time the entire of the new great Medical Schools have
been finished, which, in addition to Professors’ rooms and lecture-rooms, contain a fine chamber
specially fitted up for the great pathological collection originally purchased from the late Doctor
Robert Smith, whose lectures as Professor of Surgery had a large share in the great recent success
of the school. This collection has been largely added to by the indefatigable labours of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
successor, Doctor Edward H. Bennett. The anatomy and chemistry lecture-rooms of 1824 were
completely removed, in order to make a space for part of the present range of buildings,
which have been completed at a cost of over £20,000.</p>

<p>In a lecture delivered in 1837, the Professor of the Practice of Physic (Doctor Lendrick)
attributed to Provost Bartholomew Lloyd the improvements which were even at that time
beginning to be effected in the medical education of the members of the College. “The
candidate for a medical degree,” he said, “no longer finishes his medical education in a single year,
nor is he compelled to complete a septennial period of (perhaps) idleness before being permitted
to practise his profession.” In the years 1832-42, inclusive, the average number of degrees of
Bachelor of Medicine annually conferred by the University was 18. In the next decade this
number fell to 11·7. After the great improvements in the medical education and the appointment
of more attractive lecturers, this number rapidly increased. In the decade 1872-1881 the
average was 39, in the following ten years the annual average was 43·6, being nearly four
times that of forty years before the present time.</p>

<p>During the first half of the present century the University conferred degrees in Medicine
only. The Irish College of Surgeons, towards the end of that period, refused to recognise the
lectures delivered in the Medical School of Trinity College as a part of the professional education
required for a surgical diploma, although two of the Trinity College Professors had previously
occupied a similar position in the College of Surgeons’ School. The University of Dublin was
consequently, in 1851, obliged to institute for their medical graduates a diploma or license in
Surgery. This they did, following the best legal advice, under the clause in their charter
which gave them authority to grant degrees “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in omnibus artibus et facultatibus</i>.” This was
followed by the institution, in 1858, of the degree of Master of Surgery. This degree was, by the
Act 21 and 22 Victoria, chap. 90, recognised as a qualification for the holder to be placed in the
Medical Register&mdash;a privilege which was afterwards, by the Act 23 Victoria, chap. 7, extended to
diplomas or licenses in Surgery. In 1872 the degree of Bachelor of Surgery was instituted, and
placed on the basis of Bachelor of Medicine. To be admitted to either of these degrees the
candidate must have previously graduated in Arts, and must have spent four years in the study
of Medicine and Surgery. Degrees are now given also in Obstetric Art. The University of
Dublin was the first in modern times to institute degrees in Surgery, and its example has
been since followed by Cambridge and other English, Irish, and Scotch Universities.</p>

<p>The change of opinion in the Universities with respect to the status of the profession of
Surgery is well illustrated by a correspondence, which has been preserved in the College Register,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
between the University of Cambridge and the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin. On June
30, 1804, a letter was received from the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, in which it was stated that
that University had declined to consider any student who had, subsequently to his admission,
practised any trade or profession whatsoever as qualified for a degree, and consequently had
refused this to Frederick Thackeray, who, since the time of his admission as an undergraduate,
had been constantly engaged in the practice of surgery. The Provost and Senior Fellows, in
reply, informed the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge that, after consideration of his letter, they had
agreed to adopt the same regulation.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century, before Sir Patrick Dun’s Hospital was erected, great
difficulty was experienced in the clinical instruction of the medical students. In 1800 the
Governors of Stevens’ Hospital permitted Dr. Crampton to give reports of medical cases under
his care in the Hospital for the winter six months to matriculated medical students, and to none
others. Attendance on these lectures was required for medical degrees. In 1804 clinical lectures
by Dr. Whitley Stokes at the Meath Hospital were considered to be adequate for this purpose.
In 1806, attendance for six months with Doctor Crampton at Stevens’ Hospital was sanctioned
by the College of Physicians as adequate for a medical degree. On the completion in 1808 of
the west wing of Dun’s Hospital, which had been commenced in 1803, the clinical instruction
connected with the School of Physic was given in the wards and lecture-rooms of the Hospital;
and in 1835 candidates for medical degrees were required to present a certificate of one year’s
attendance at this institution. Sir Patrick Dun’s Hospital was originally intended for medical
cases only, but in 1864 the College of Physicians, which had hitherto occupied the central position
of the building as a library and Convocation Hall, transferred this part of the building to the
Governors of the Hospital, and it was enlarged and changed into a medico-chirurgical institution
for the complete instruction of the students both in Medicine and Surgery. Attendance at this
hospital is no longer compulsory on the candidates for degrees; nine other Dublin hospitals are
joined with it, and the student may, if he wishes, receive his clinical teaching in any of these.</p>

<p>In the early part of the century, Trinity College for a short time granted diplomas in
Medicine to matriculated students who were not students in Arts, but who attended the same
lectures and passed the same examinations as were required of Bachelors of Medicine. This
system prevailed up to 1823, when the Board received a letter from the College of Physicians in
London, in which it was stated that that College did not consider such a diploma as sufficient to
warrant them to grant an examination for a license to practise physic in England. The issue of
these diplomas was then discontinued. For a short period the degree of Bachelor of Medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was granted to students who had completed two years’ study in Arts, but this was found to be so
unsatisfactory, that the University decided that no one should be admitted to a degree in Medicine
or in Surgery who had not previously graduated as Bachelor of Arts.</p>

<p>As to the method of conducting examinations for degrees in Medicine, we gather some
curious information from a letter which the College of Physicians sent to the Provost and Senior
Fellows in October, 1814, in which they informed the Board that they had ordered the King’s
Professor not to be present at any examination for medical degrees in the University in
which any question may be put, or answer received, in the English language. The Registrar
was directed to write to the Regius Professor of Physic (Dr. Hill) to inquire whether these
examinations were conducted in Latin. In reply, Dr. Hill assured the Board that he would
not, under any circumstances, examine in English. It may be conjectured that the newly-elected
Professor of Anatomy (Mr. Macartney), who was not a University man, broke through the old
rule as to the language in which he examined.</p>

<p>The great growth of medical and surgical studies in the University may be gathered from
the number of the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine which have been conferred at different
periods of the present century. In nearly all cases, students of the University who now
graduate in Medicine take also degrees in Surgery and the Obstetric Art. The number of
Medical Matriculations for the last three years has been as follows:&mdash;1889&mdash;Students in Arts,
55, Externs, 28; 1890&mdash;Students in Arts, 61, Externs, 26; 1891&mdash;Students in Arts, 100,
Externs, 28. During the five years previous to 1889 these numbers averaged&mdash;Students in Arts,
62; Externs, 34; total of each year, 96. The religious professions of the medical students
who were matriculated in 1891 were as follows:&mdash;Church of Ireland, 85; Church of England,
10; Presbyterian, 12; Roman Catholics, 12; Methodists, 6; other denominations, 3;&mdash;total, 128.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">Arts Course.</span> 1792-1892.&mdash;At the beginning of this period, and for some years
after, there were four academic Terms each year, during which the students, both undergraduates
and graduates, attended lectures. In each Term two days were set apart, according to the
directions of the Statutes, for the general examinations of all the undergraduate classes. It
was found that the increasing number of students could not be properly examined in this
limited time. Application was made to the Crown for a Royal letter giving power to the
Provost and Senior Fellows to increase the number of days for this purpose in each Term,
and a Statute to that effect was enacted in 1792. In the following year a new and greatly
improved list of the subjects for each examination in all the parts of the Undergraduate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Course was adopted.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> At the same time, a scheme was devised for stimulating the study
of the Greek and Latin Classics, and for extending the cultivation of Latin Composition, both
in prose and verse, by special prizes at these examinations.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The subjects for the examination
for admission to the College were also carefully re-modelled and set out for the use of
schools; and in 1794 a well-devised system of examinations and of prizes for proficiency
in Hebrew was instituted. Yet at this period there were no special lectures for advanced
students, either in Mathematics or in Classics. The dull and the clever student were taught
together, both at the public lectures and by the College Tutor; and at the Term Examinations
all the students in each division were taken together, the Examiner having at the same time,
in a very limited number of hours, to satisfy himself of the progress which each undergraduate
had made in his studies, to distinguish between the idle and the diligent, between
the badly and the well-prepared, and at the same time to pick out and reward the best
answerer in each division of about forty students.</p>

<p>The first earnest attempt to provide Classical instruction of a higher order for the
better class of students was devised by Provost Kearney in 1800. Special Classical Lectures
were arranged to be given by the ablest scholars among the Fellows twice a-week, at 7 a.m.
The first special Lecturers appointed for this purpose were&mdash;Dr. Miller in Greek, and Mr.
Walker in Latin. These lectures appear to have been instituted for the purpose of advancing
the classical studies of such graduates as intended to devote themselves to the instruction of
boys in schools; for it was arranged, at the same time, that every graduate, who should
appear to the Provost and Senior Fellows to merit such encouragement, was to be entitled
to a certificate under the College Seal testifying that he was “qualified to instruct youth in
the grammatical principles, the classical idioms, and the prosody of the Greek and Latin
languages.” The salary of each of these Lecturers was fixed at £40 annually. In 1804, Dr.
Miller was succeeded by Mr. Kyle as Lecturer in Greek, and Mr. Walker by Mr. Nash as Lecturer
in Latin. In 1801 the Professor of Oratory was authorised to give prizes for excellent answering
at the lectures delivered by him and his assistants; and, in order to stimulate the study
of the Hebrew language at school, prizes for good answering in that subject, at the monthly
entrance examinations, were instituted; and in order to encourage further the study of
composition, both in Greek, Latin, and English Prose and Verse, in 1805 the Vice-Chancellor
assigned that portion of the fees for Degrees which was then payable to him, to form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
fund for prizes, to be given at the time of the Commencements, for the best compositions in
each branch. In 1808 Catechetical Lectures and Examinations in Holy Scripture for the two
Freshmen classes on the basis of the ordinary Term Examinations were first instituted, and,
at the same time, regular weekly instruction by the Clerical Fellows in a fixed course of
Holy Scripture and religious knowledge was arranged. On the same occasion Algebra was
for the first time made a part of the Undergraduate Course, the only Mathematics which all
the students had been taught before that time being four books of the Elements of Euclid.</p>

<p>In order to stimulate the more advanced students to an increased pursuit of Mathematical
Physics, Dr. Bartholomew Lloyd was appointed to deliver lectures on Mechanics at
a salary of £100 annually, on the condition that he should resign his claims to any other
Professorship, Lectureship, or Assistant’s place, except that of Catechetical Lecturer. In 1815
a new scheme of Mathematical Lectures was promulgated. The following distribution of the
work to be done by the Professor and his assistants was arranged by the Provost and
Senior Fellows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Junior Assistant to lecture on Arithmetic and Algebra to Biquadratic Equations, including
Newton’s Method of approximation to roots of Equations, also on the application of Algebra to Geometry
as given by Newton. The Senior Assistant to lecture on Logarithms, Analytical Trigonometry, with
its application to Terrestrial Measurement, application of Algebra to Geometry managed by the equations
of figures. The Professor to lecture on the more advanced parts of Mathematics, including the
Method of Indeterminate Coefficients, with its application to the management of Series, and other
matters not contained in the Course of the Assistant, also Differential and Integral Calculus and the
Method of Variations.</p></div>

<p>The programme of the subjects of these lectures shows that there was a large advance
in the mathematical education of the students made at this time. Analytical Geometry
and Trigonometry were taught to the Honour men among the undergraduates, and the
Differential and Integral Calculus and the higher branches of Mathematics were expounded
by the Professor of Mathematics to the candidates for Fellowship. Hitherto the mathematical
studies of the members of the College were mainly geometrical. The great start in
analytical science, which has developed itself so largely in the University, seems to date
from this time, and is due very much to the influence of Dr. Bartholomew Lloyd, who had
in 1813 been appointed to the Chair of Mathematics. It was not until 1830 that a similar
progress was made in the study of Mixed Mathematics. We find that in November of that
year a committee, consisting of the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Dr. Wall, was appointed to recommend to the Board a proper course of Mixed Mathematics,
and they were instrumental in introducing the Mechanics of Poisson into the subjects for
examination for the higher mathematical honours. A small but important improvement in
the existing method of conducting the Term Examinations of ordinary students was made
at the same time. Hitherto some of the classes were submitted to be tested by the same
Junior Fellow in Science and in Classics. In 1831 it was decided that these branches of
studies should be judged by separate examiners in every case. At this time there was no
special examination for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Senior Sophister students who
answered in an unsatisfactory manner at the Michaelmas Term Examination were “sent to
the Regent House” to be examined.</p>

<p>In 1807 it was decreed that every student who is “cautioned to the Regent House”
shall be examined in every part of the Undergraduate Course for which he has got a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mediocriter</i> at his last examination. It was not until October, 1838, that this examination
in the Regent House was formally discontinued, although it had fallen into disuse. It was
then arranged that one <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vix mediocriter</i> for the B.A. degree should subject the candidate to
another examination.</p>

<p>This is the suitable occasion upon which to mention in detail the great services which
the mild energy and enlightened views of Dr. Bartholomew Lloyd performed in the reformation
of the studies and the literary work of Trinity College. To no one man during the
present century does the University owe so much. A native of the County of Wexford, he
was elected a Fellow in 1796, and after a service of twenty years as College Tutor, which
he discharged with zeal and ability, he was co-opted to a Senior Fellowship in 1816, and he
was appointed to the Provostship in 1831. Dr. Lloyd held the Professorship of Mathematics
from 1813 to 1822, when he exchanged this chair for that of Natural Philosophy. He occupied
the latter office until he was made Provost, and he was thus for eighteen years engaged in
the direction of the highest studies of the most advanced classes in the branches of Pure and
Mixed Mathematics. He quickly saw the need of introducing a more complete knowledge
of the more advanced analytic methods which prevailed on the Continent, and he compiled
a course of lectures, as we have seen, in order to introduce them to his class; and partly by
his lectures and partly by his writings<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> he completely revolutionised the mathematical and
physical studies of the University, and was the means of directing the researches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
higher class of thinkers to the methods which have rendered the Dublin school of mathematicians
so celebrated in Europe.</p>

<p>Shortly after his appointment to the Chair of Natural Philosophy, he published his
well-known treatise on Mechanical Philosophy, which supplied a want widely felt by students
of that science in this and the sister country, and which was the means of introducing to
them the researches of the French labourers in the field of Applied Mathematics.</p>

<p>During the six years of his Provostship he was the means of effecting very large and
beneficial changes in the College. Up to 1831 all the important Professorships were held
by Senior Fellows, and in most cases (except in those on the foundation of Erasmus Smith)
they were held, like other College offices, as the result of an annual election. Dr. Lloyd saw
the necessity of setting apart some of the Junior Fellows for the fixed and exclusive work
of Professorial study and teaching. For this purpose he influenced the College Board to set
apart three of the Junior Fellows, whose tastes were specially directed to these particular
studies, to the Professorships of Mathematics, of Natural Philosophy, and the office of
Archbishop King’s Lectureship in Divinity. Mr. M‘Cullagh was elected to the first of these
chairs, Mr. Humphrey Lloyd to the second, and Dr. O’Brien to the third. They were freed
from all the distracting cares of College Tutors, and the salaries were fixed at something
rather below the average value of a Junior Fellowship. The tenure of the Professorship
was terminated by the co-option of the holder to a place among the Senior Fellows. The
Fellowship Examination was improved by a Royal Statute which was then obtained, and
which enabled the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy to be called up to
undertake the examination in the courses belonging to their respective chairs.</p>

<p>Provost Bartholomew Lloyd saw also the necessity of fostering the study of Mental
and Moral Philosophy among the members of the College. Prior to 1833 the study of these
sciences was joined with that of Mathematics and Physics under the common designation of
<em>Science</em>. But for the attainment of prizes and other University distinctions, the Mathematical
part of the examination placed that of the Logical and Ethical portions of the curriculum
completely in the background. In 1833 a new system of awarding Honours and Medals at
the Degree Examination was instituted, and in addition to the distinctions in Mathematics
and Classics, which had been in existence since the year 1815, a third course was fixed for
a separate examination in Ethics and Logics, and gold and silver medals were awarded for
distinguished answering in these subjects, in addition to the similar rewards for merit under
the designation of Senior and Junior Moderatorships in Mathematics and in Classics. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
arrangement was carried out in 1834, and the first name in the list of Ethical Moderators
of that year was that of William Archer Butler&mdash;a brilliant and afterwards most distinguished
man, both as a writer and a preacher, who was taken away by death from the service of the
Church and of the University at the early age of thirty-four.</p>

<p>Provost Lloyd had long seen the necessity of a separate Professorship of the Moral
Sciences, and in 1837 he induced the Governing Body of the University to found it. On the
day on which it was instituted Archer Butler was appointed to the Professorship, which he
held for ten years, much to the benefit of the class of thinkers to whom these studies
were interesting. By these arrangements Dr. Lloyd may be well said to be the founder of
the distinguished school of Metaphysics which has taken such deep root in the College, and
has borne much fruit. In 1850, mainly through the exertions of his son, Dr. Humphrey
Lloyd, a fourth Moderatorship in Experimental Physics was founded.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> But it was not only
with the advancement of higher class education that Provost Lloyd was engaged: he
effected enormous improvements in the lectures and examinations of the undergraduates at
large. To this he was stimulated by a remarkably thoughtful and searching pamphlet, written
in 1828 by Dr. Richard MacDonnell, who was then a Junior Fellow, and had an experience of
twenty years of the great defects in the method of conducting the Term Examinations.
Most of the suggestions in this pamphlet were adopted in course of time. Before the year
1833 the work of the College was distributed over four separate Terms, at the beginning of
each of which the students were examined in the subjects in which they had been
instructed during the previous Term. These Terms were of unequal and variable length.
The Easter Term was far too short for the appointed course of study; and the Trinity
Term, depending on the movable feasts, was often merely nominal. In order to obviate
these inconveniences, the Provost and Senior Fellows applied for and obtained a Royal Statute
reducing the number of Academic Terms from four to three, and fixing them so that they
would be generally of equal length. The hours of examination for each class of students
were altered so as to meet the change of social habits; and while it was formerly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
custom to have the first part of the examination of each day to continue from 8 a.m. to 10
a.m., followed by a breakfast at the chambers of the College Tutors, in 1833 the change
was made to the present hours of examination&mdash;from 9.30 to 12 in the morning of the first
day, and from 10 to 12 in the morning of the second day of each Term Examination.
The subjects of the Undergraduate Course were in the same year submitted to a very
wide-reaching review.</p>

<p>In the year 1793, great improvements had been made in the Classical Course set out
for the studies of the undergraduates. These were, it is said, largely due to the influence of
Dr. Thomas Elrington. On that occasion the works of the great Greek historians, Herodotus
and Thucydides, were brought for the first time under the attention of the classical students
in Trinity College; but, during the forty years which followed, little change had been made
in the classical authors which were read by the undergraduates. In 1833, for the first time, a
distinct and shorter course was arranged for students who were not candidates for Honours,
while a larger portion, generally of the same authors, was set out for candidates for Honours,
and a wider course of classical studies was appointed for those who competed for Classical
Moderatorships at the Degree Examination. Similar arrangements were adopted for the
students in the Mathematical and Physical portion of their curriculum.</p>

<p>Before this time the students of the same division, of from thirty to forty men, were
examined together, and they had no opportunity of competing with other men of their year
in the Sciences; and in classical studies at the Scholarship Examination only, at which they
rarely competed until the third year. It was now arranged that those who answered well at
each Term Examination in Science or in Classics should be returned by the Examiner to
compete at a more searching examination in an extended course, at which all the best men
in the class should be examined together, on days separate from those of the Term
Examinations, by three Examiners in Science and three in Classics set apart for that purpose;
and so by this means each student was able to measure himself each Term, not only with
those who happened to be in his own division, but with all the men of his year; and in this
way the undergraduates were incited to continued study by healthy competition. Premiums
in books, which were formerly awarded at each examination to the best answerer in each
division, but which could be obtained only once in the year, were confined to that of the
Michaelmas Term, at which there were two orders of prizes, first and second&mdash;the number
of the first rank prizes being restricted to one fortieth of the class, and that of the second to
one twentieth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another and a very important improvement in the teaching of the undergraduates
which Provost Lloyd was mainly instrumental in effecting. Hitherto the lectures of
each Tutor were given to his own pupils. He was supposed to instruct all the men of each of
the three Junior Classes at the least for an hour every day. Each Tutor received the fees of
his own pupils, and those who had a large number in what was technically called his “chamber”
had a considerable income, but others who were not so popular had but a scanty support.</p>

<p>In 1835 the Tutors, under the persuasion of the Provost, agreed to adopt a new system.
The fees paid by the pupils were put into a common fund, and the Tutors were divided into
three grades, in the order of seniority, and their dividends were fixed, not in relation to the
number of their pupils, but of the standing of the Tutor among the Fellows; each of them was
thus assured of a certain and increasing income&mdash;the only advantage accruing to the Tutor from
the number of his pupils arose from the arrangement that, when he ceased from any cause to be
a Tutor, the payments of the Tutorial fees of his existing pupils, as long as they remained in
College, instead of being paid into the common fund, were paid to the Tutor himself or to his
representatives.</p>

<p>A corresponding division of Tutorial labour, as far as lectures were concerned, was
effected at the same time. Each Tutor was required to lecture only two hours every day,
except on Saturday; and the efficacy of the lectures was greatly increased, and the regularity of
the attendance of the lecturer in the instruction of his class guarded by stringent rules. Every
student in the two Freshman Classes was now lectured for two hours instead of one; under the
old arrangement the lecture in Classics was often a mere form, not always observed; by the new
system an hour’s lecture in Latin was secured to each undergraduate in these classes. The
Junior Sophisters were lectured by the Tutors in Mathematical Physics and Astronomy only.
In addition to the Tutorial Lectures, the undergraduates attended, as they did before, the
Public Science Lectures, the hours of the lecture being changed from 6.15 to 7.30 a.m.,
and the lectures of the assistants to the Greek Professor on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, which were delivered at 9 a.m. Again, there was a great improvement effected
with respect to the attendance of the undergraduates at Tutorial Lectures. At this time
these lectures were not obligatory; Terms were not kept by attendance at them, nor did the
College keep any record of them. A student did not advance in any way his College
standing by seeking the instruction given by his College Tutor. No cognizance was taken
of irregularity, either on the part of the lecturer or of the lectured. A Tutor was often
absent from his class, and the class was oftener absent from the Tutor. An important rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was adopted to counteract this: a weekly return was required to be made to the Tutorial
Committee of the attendance upon his lectures, which was to be transmitted to the Provost,
and the Tutor had an opportunity of judging of the regularity of the studies of his pupils,
who were, according to this inter-tutorial system, in attendance on the lectures of other
Tutors. In a very few years the lectures were much better arranged, some of the Tutors
being set apart to lecture the candidates for Honours in each class, while others devoted
themselves to the greater drudgery of instructing the mere pass-men.</p>

<p>In order to secure the diligent discharge of the duties assigned to each Tutor, the
Tutorial Committee was bound to employ deputies to lecture in his place in case of his
failure from any cause, and to remunerate the deputies out of the income of the defaulting Tutor.</p>

<p>That this division of labour added very much to the ease of the conscientious Tutors
is quite evident. Doctor Romney Robinson, who was a Fellow and Tutor under the old
system, wrote as follows in the preface to his treatise on Mechanics, published in 1820:&mdash;“The
Fellows of Trinity College can scarcely be expected to devote themselves to any
work of research, or even of compilation; constantly employed in the duties of tuition, which
harass the mind more than the most abstract studies, they can have but little inclination at
the close of the day to commence a new career of labour.... In the present case
the author happened to be less occupied than most of his brethren, yet he was engaged
from seven to eight hours daily in academical duties, for the year during which he composed
this work.”</p>

<p>Had Bartholomew Lloyd lived, he would no doubt have originated many other
improvements in the Arts Course, and in the other studies of the College which have been
effected since his time. He was, however, suddenly removed by death from his exertions
in reforming the College, on the 24th November, 1837, at the age of 65, having held the
Provostship for only six years. He was succeeded by Dr. Franc Sadleir, and during the
fourteen years of his mild sway the improvements originated by his predecessor were
gradually carried into effect. Dr. Richard MacDonnell succeeded him in the office of
Provost. He had been long engaged in the work of the College as an able and painstaking
Tutor, and a vigorous administrator of the College Estates. Dr. MacDonnell had long seen
the necessity of large reforms in the education of the students, and had ably pointed out
the abuses which required to be remedied, in the pamphlet which has been already mentioned.
Most of these defects he lived to see corrected, and the most important of which were
removed when he was himself Provost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the events which, beyond question, stimulated intellectual exertions among the
undergraduates in the University of Dublin, was the opening of the appointments in the Civil
Service of India, and of the Army and Navy Medical Service, to public competition in
1855. A number of the ablest students had a new career opened to them, and they were
afforded an opportunity of measuring their attainments with students of similar calibre from
Oxford and Cambridge. The course of study was at once widened. Classical studies
received an impetus which roused the teachers from their old routine. The English
Language and Literature, and Modern History, as well as foreign languages, became important
parts of Collegiate education. The heads of the College at once saw the necessity of largely
remodelling the instruction given to the undergraduates. The Greek Professorship was very
soon separated from the offices which were restricted to Senior Fellows; a Professor was
elected from among the Tutors under the same arrangements which had been carried out in
the cases of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics. He was enabled to give his entire time
to the duties of his chair. Similar arrangements were made as to the Professorships of
Geology and of Experimental Physics. A Professor of Arabic and Hindostanee was
established, and soon after one of Sanskrit as well. The Professorship of Oratory was
virtually changed into one of English Language and Literature. The immediate effect
of these changes was at once visible in the great and remarkable success of the Dublin
candidates at the open competitions for the Indian Civil Service and the Army Medical
Services. In the first seven years, fifty-three succeeded from the Dublin University for
the former and twenty-nine for the latter appointments. The new regulations with regard
to the study of English Literature which were made in 1855 have produced very widely
felt effects in the intellectual life of the University. It was not for the first time that a
want of the means of being acquainted with this important branch of knowledge was felt
by the students; and in order to remedy it, in October, 1814, during the Provostship of
Dr. Thomas Elrington, the Board directed that lectures in the English Language and
Literature should be regularly delivered by the assistant to the Professor of Oratory, and
elaborate rules were made as to the means of carrying this course into effect, but it seems
to have ended in failure; at any rate, during the next forty years there was no public
instruction given to the students in this important subject. The plan adopted in 1855 of
making History and English Literature a distinct branch, in which honours and medals at
the Degree Examination can be obtained, aided by the special prizes which are given for
proficiency in these subjects during the Undergraduate Course, has created a widely felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
interest among the students, and has eventuated in the spread of a refined taste for these
subjects among the members of the College. The subjects in which the student can
distinguish himself at the B.A. Degree Examination have now been increased to seven&mdash;1,
Mathematics, pure and mixed; 2, Classics; 3, Mental and Moral Science; 4, Experimental
Physics; 5, Natural Sciences; 6, History, Law, and Political Economy; 7, Foreign Languages
and Literature. Frequent and well-considered changes in the courses for the ordinary
students, and in the subjects read by the candidates for Honours, have been made since that
period, and they have been on the whole successful.</p>

<p>One of the most marked developments in the intellectual life of the College during
the present century has been the growth of the great Classical School for which it is now
so well known. This may be mainly attributed to the separation of Classics from the other
branches which form the subject of competition for Fellowships. A keen competition among
Classical men for those highly-coveted prizes has been the consequence. The tone of
Classical Scholarship has been raised among the best of the candidates for University
Honours, and some of the ablest men devote themselves to stimulate the knowledge of the
Greek and Latin Languages and Literature among the students. There has, moreover, a
higher Critical School grown up in the University, limited in numbers, being composed of
Classical Graduates who are engaged in reading for Fellowship, or who have competed for
the Berkeley Medals in Greek, or for the Vice-Chancellor’s Medals in Latin. This school,
exclusive of the Fellows and Professors, never numbers more than ten or twelve in the
College at one time, but from the ability and classical culture of its members it has more
influence in giving a tone to the studies which are pursued in the University than its
numbers would at first sight render probable. The causes of the growth of this school are&mdash;1st,
the Critical Examination for the highest Classical distinctions; 2nd, the fact that there
is an examination for Fellowship every year; 3rd, the annual publication of <cite>Hermathena</cite>;
4th, the publication of critical editions of the Classics by the Fellows of the College.</p>

<p>We can trace the growth of the Mathematical studies to the wonderful genius of MacCullagh
and Hamilton, and to the labours of Townsend, of Jellett, of Roberts, and of others
who have passed away. Fortunately for the College, all the creators of the revived School
of Classics are still spared to the College, and their names are therefore not here mentioned.</p>

<p>Another vast improvement effected was in the method of conducting all examinations in
the College. Prior to 1835 they were (with the solitary exceptions of those for gold medals
at the B.A. Degree Examinations) altogether oral. The examination for Fellowships was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
public <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i> trial of the candidates, and in the Latin language, without any use whatever
of writing. Greek authors were translated into Latin, and Latin authors were interpreted
in the same language. This continued to be the practice down to the year 1853. Now, all
this is changed. The Fellowship Examination, which is spread over a much longer period,
is mostly conducted in writing, although there is in every course a public examination of the
candidates <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</i> and in English. The examinations for Honours (except in Classical
subjects) are now altogether written, and at the ordinary Term Examinations students are
tested orally and by written questions by separate Examiners. At the general Term
Examination at the end of the second year, and at the B.A. Degree Examination at the
end of the fourth year, the candidates are arranged according to their answering in three
classes, and those whose marks do not entitle them to be classed, but who satisfy the
Senior Lecturer, are passed without any mark of distinction. This method of examination
for the B.A. degree was adopted in July, 1842, at the suggestion of the then Senior Lecturer,
Dr. Singer, afterwards Bishop of Meath. It was found to work in such a satisfactory
manner that, in 1845, it was adopted at the other public University Examination, at the
end of the second or Senior Freshman year.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">Engineering School.</span>&mdash;The University of Dublin was the first to establish a course
of education and degrees in the art of Civil Engineering. Shortly after the construction of
railways in Ireland was undertaken, there was a necessity found for properly educated men
to carry on the required work; and the plan of an Engineering School originated with
Doctor Humphrey Lloyd, Professor of Natural Philosophy; Doctor MacCullagh, Professor of
Mathematics; and Doctor Luby, Assistant Professor of Natural Philosophy. These three
gentlemen laid a memorial before the Provost and Senior Fellows on April 3rd, 1841,
recommending the foundation of a Professorship of Civil Engineering, and giving a plan for
the studies of the proposed school for teaching that branch of education. This was finally
approved by the Board early in the following June. The length of the course as first
proposed was two years, and on July 9th, 1842, Mr. M‘Neill (afterwards Sir John M‘Neill) was
elected to the Professorship. It was arranged that the business of the School of Engineering
should be conducted by five lecturers&mdash;viz., the assistant to the Professor of Mathematics,
the Professor of Natural Philosophy and his assistant, together with a Professor of Chemistry
and of Geology applied to the art of Construction, and a Professor of the practice of
Engineering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. M‘Neill was so completely occupied with his large works in the construction of
railways that he could give only a general superintendence to the school, and on the 5th of
November, 1842, Mr. Henry Rennie, formerly a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, was
appointed Assistant Professor and Lecturer. After holding the office for two years he
resigned, and Mr. Thomas Oldham, B.A., was appointed in his room. Doctor Apjohn was
elected to the joint Professorships of Chemistry and Geology; but in 1843 it was found
necessary to appoint a distinct Professor of Geology, and on December 30th, 1843, Mr. John
Phillips, the eminent geologist, was elected to this chair at a salary of £200, to be increased
to £400 on the death of Doctor Whitley Stokes, then an old man, which took place in
1845. In the latter year Mr. Phillips resigned the Professorship, and he was succeeded by
Mr. Thomas Oldham, afterwards Director of the Geological Survey of India. In 1846 Mr.
Samuel Downing was appointed to the Professorship of Engineering, which he continued
to hold until his death in 1882.</p>

<p>It was soon found that a two years’ course in Engineering was insufficient, and in
1845 it was extended to one of three years. The studies of the first year are in the main
theoretical; in the second and third years they are practical&mdash;viz., drawing and office work,
levelling, surveying and general engineering, and chemistry as taught in the laboratory.</p>

<p>At first, diplomas in Engineering were granted to students who had passed successfully
through this school. In 1860 it was resolved by the University Senate that in lieu of these
the license of the University should be conferred publicly at the Commencements; and in
1872 it was further resolved that the degree of Bachelor in Civil Engineering should be
created, and that it should be conferred on Bachelors of Arts who were entitled to the
license by having completed the full course in Engineering. From the year 1860 to 1891
inclusive, 352 students obtained degrees and licenses in Engineering. The degree of
Master of Engineering is conferred on those who, after taking the degree of Bachelor of
Engineering, have practised for three years in the work of their profession.</p>

<p>At each final examination in Engineering, special certificates are awarded to students
who answer in a distinguished manner in the following subjects:&mdash;I. Practical Engineering;
II. Mechanical and Experimental Physics; III. Mining, Chemistry, Geology, and Mineralogy.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">School of Law.</span>&mdash;The lectures of the Professor of Feudal and English Law remain
very much as they were in 1792. The Professorship of Civil Law was then and for many
years afterwards held by a Senior Fellow, often by a clergyman; the duties were nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
nominal, and the salary small. In the year 1850, however, the Board, being anxious to
found an effective Law School in Dublin, decided that in future the Professorship of
Civil Law should be held only by a Doctor of Laws, and a Barrister of at least six years
standing; and as such he was required to regulate the courses and lectures in the Civil Law
class, and bound to deliver at least twelve lectures in each Term.</p>

<p>The Law School of the University of Dublin is under the control of the Provost and
Senior Fellows of Trinity College, who, however, act in concurrence with the Benchers of
the King’s Inns.</p>

<p>The Regius Professor of Laws delivers lectures on Roman Law, Jurisprudence, and
International Law. The Regius Professor of Feudal and English Law delivers lectures on
the subject of Real Property; a third professor, whose chair was founded in 1888 by Mr.
Richard T. Reid for the study of “Penal Legislation, including principles of prevention,
repression, and reformation,” delivers lectures on&mdash;(1) Penal Legislation; (2) Constitutional
and Criminal Law; (3) the Law of Evidence. These lectures are open to the public and
King’s Inns students, who have credit for the Term’s lectures, and those who have credit
for the academic year have their names reported to the Benchers.</p>

<p>The Law Professors also examine all candidates for degrees in Law. These degrees,
like those in the other professional schools, can only be obtained after a course of legal
study or strict examinations in Law.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE COLLEGE SOCIETIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The College Historical Society</span>, which was formed in 1770, had in 1794 come
into collision with the Governing Body of the College, in consequence of the action of
many of the Graduates of some years’ standing, who, though they were no longer subject to
College discipline, continued to be active members of the Society, and acted without respect
to the orders of the Board. The Society was consequently excluded from the College, and
a new Association of the Students, under the same name, was organised. Their meetings for
debate were permitted by the Board, on the distinct understanding that they would not
choose for discussion any question of modern politics, or admit into their proceedings any
allusion to such subjects. They continued to meet in the old rooms, now the Common
Room of the Fellows and Professors, until 1815, when they again got into trouble with the
College authorities, who insisted that they should expel, without discussion, two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
members of the Society whose conduct in its debates was disapproved of by the Board.
The discussions upon the private business of the Society became imbued by party spirit,
and the younger members, who exceeded in number the seniors, who had greater experience
and wisdom, took upon themselves the management of the Historical Society, and it became
continually engaged in angry debates. The Board consequently insisted that Junior
Sophisters should be no longer admitted as members, and ordered a committee of five to be
appointed to settle all private business of the Society. Four of the five refused to act, and
the result was that on the 5th of February, 1815, the last debate was held. It is a strange
coincidence that, shortly afterwards, similar difficulties arose between the Cambridge <em>Union</em>
and the Cambridge University authorities. In the month of March, 1817,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Mr. Whewell
was President. Dr. Wood, at that time Vice-Chancellor, took with him the Proctors,
together with a Tutor from Trinity College, and another from St. John’s: they proceeded
to the place of meeting for debate, at the Red Lion Inn. The Proctors were sent into the
room to desire the members to disperse, and to meet no more. The President requested
the Proctors to retire, in order that the Society might discuss the subject. This they
refused to do. At last a deputation, consisting of Mr. Whewell (afterwards Master of
Trinity), Mr. Thirlwall (afterwards Bishop of St. David’s), and Mr. Sheridan, was permitted
to have an interview with the Vice-Chancellor. The deputation urged their claims strongly,
but the Vice-Chancellor insisted that, while they might conclude the present debate, they
should not meet again for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>After frequent petitions to the Board, supported by the Junior Fellows, the Historical
Society was again, on the 16th November, 1843, permitted to meet within the walls of the
College, on which occasion William Connor Magee, Scholar, afterwards Archbishop of York,
delivered, as Auditor of the Society, an opening address of remarkable eloquence and of
great promise, which produced an effect such as has never yet been equalled in the Society.
Since that period the College Historical Society continues to meet regularly for debate
within the College walls. Junior Sophisters are again admitted as members, but the subjects
for discussion must always, in the first instance, receive the approval of the Board. The
Society has been allowed, moreover, to have Reading and Committee Rooms within the
College. During the half-century which has elapsed since the restoration of the Society,
perfect harmony has existed between the members and the Governing Body of the College.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">The Philosophical Society.</span>&mdash;During the year 1842, some of the students of
Trinity College whose age and reputation did not warrant their seeking admission into the
leading scientific societies of Dublin, but who were anxious to improve themselves in
knowledge and in the art of composition, combined to form a Society called the Dublin
Philosophical Society, the object of which was the reading of papers on scientific and
literary subjects, and the discussion of these papers by the members after they were read.
The first meeting was held in November, 1842, in a room in Marlborough Street, and the
first volume of their transactions was published at the end of 1843.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1845, after the Historical Society had been received back within
the walls of the College, the Committee sought permission to have the use of one of the
lecture-rooms for the purposes of their meetings. This was granted. The name of the
Society was changed into “The Dublin University Philosophical Society,” and new rules
were adopted, which were required by the closer connection of the Society with Trinity
College. The members were nearly all graduates, and although junior students were by no
means excluded from the Society, few of them were disposed to join in the proceedings.
The Society continued to exist for some years, but the members, being generally senior
men, were too soon called away from aiding in its meetings by the requirements of
professional or official duties. This Society published five volumes of Transactions,
containing papers by young men, many of whom afterwards became distinguished in science
and literature.</p>

<p>The Society having fallen too much into the hands of graduates, in the year
1854 the undergraduates, feeling the want of a similar organisation which should give
them free scope for their own literary exertions, formed a new Society called “The
Undergraduate Philosophical Society,” the ruling body of which was composed of students
who had not taken their B.A. degrees. The new Society became rapidly popular among
the students of the College, and its numbers largely increased. The first Philosophical
Society having been at length discontinued, that which was managed by the undergraduates
took its place as the University Philosophical Society. All undergraduates <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'are now admissable'">are now
admissible</ins> as members, and at present it so happens that the majority of the officers of
the Society and the Committee are graduates.</p>

<p>At the first, the spirit which actuated the former Philosophical Society influenced its
younger sister, and scientific subjects formed the main topic of discussion. After one or
two sessions, essays and discussions on literary subjects were introduced, followed by poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
fiction, biography, and history; so that ultimately questions of abstract science disappeared
from the proceedings of the Philosophical Society, and questions of pure science are now
discussed at the meetings of the University Biological Association and the University
Experimental Science Association.</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p><span class="smcap">The Theological Society.</span>&mdash;Shortly after the Divinity School was placed upon
its present basis, it was found that a place of meeting was required where theological
students could discuss the important questions which formed the subjects to which their
attention was directed. The Society was founded outside the College on November 23,
1838. Its first presidents were Rev. Doctor Singer, then a Junior Fellow, the Rev. Robert
J. M‘Ghee, and the Rev. Charles M. Fleury. The Society met in a room in Upper
Sackville Street, and the discussions of the members were very much confined to the Roman
Catholic controversy. It was soon found necessary that the Society should be brought more
under the control of the teachers in the Divinity School, and in 1860 the then Regius
Professor of Divinity was appointed President; the other Professors in the Divinity School,
along with the assistant Divinity teachers, were made Vice-Presidents; and since that year the
Society meets in a public room in the College. Dr. Butcher, the then Regius Professor,
always presided at the weekly meetings up to 1866, when he became Bishop of Meath.
His successor, Dr. Salmon, gave the same unwearied attention to the Society until he
became Provost, and the discussions of the Society, which now take a much wider range in
Theology, are always conducted under the control of the Regius Professor, or of Archbishop
King’s Lecturer in Divinity.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_98_98" id="Footnote_98_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> These stamp duties had been imposed on the English Universities by an English Act of Parliament (55 Geo. III.,
cap. 184), but were not exacted in Ireland. In 1842, when Sir Robert Peel imposed an Income Tax on England, from which

1800 a member of the London College of Surgeons, and shortly afterwards commenced to lecture on Anatomy and Physiology
in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London. Macartney died March 6, 1843, aged 73 years. He left a sum of money to defray the
cost of editing and publishing an account of his life and labours. This task was committed to the care of his nephew, at one
time his Demonstrator, Hugh Carlile, or Carlisle, who died in 1860, as Professor of Anatomy and Physiology, at Queen’s College,
Belfast, before he made any marked progress in this work. The executors then handed the material left partly sorted by Carlisle
to Dr. E. Perceval Wright, but on the decease of the executors, while the work was in preparation, it was found that the money
for the book was not forthcoming, and the wishes of Macartney have not yet been carried into effect.</p></div>

<p class="drop-capx">Provost Baldwin held absolute sway in this University for forty-one
years. His memory is well preserved here. The Bursar still dispenses the
satisfactory revenues which Baldwin left to the College. None of us ever
can forget the marble angels round the figure of the dying Provost on which
we used to gaze during the pangs of the Examination Hall.</p>

<p>Baldwin died in 1758, and was succeeded by Francis Andrews, a Fellow
of seventeen years’ standing. As to the scholastic acquirements of Andrews, all I
can find is a statement that he was complimented by the polite Professors of Padua on
the elegance and purity with which he discoursed to them in Latin. Andrews was also
reputed to be a skilful lawyer. He was certainly a Privy Councillor and a prominent
member of the Irish House of Commons, and his social qualities were excellent. Perhaps
it was Baldwin’s example that stimulated a desire in Andrews to become a benefactor to
his College. He accordingly bequeathed a sum of £3,000 and an annual income of £250
wherewith to build and endow an Astronomical Observatory in the University. The figures
just stated ought to be qualified by the words of cautious Ussher (afterwards the first
Professor of Astronomy), that “this money was to arise from an accumulation of a part
of his property, to commence upon a particular contingency happening in his family.”
The astronomical endowment was soon in jeopardy by litigation. Andrews thought he had
provided for his relations by leaving to them certain leasehold interests connected with the
Provost’s estate. The law courts, however, held that these interests were not at the disposal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the testator, and handed them over to Hely Hutchinson, the next Provost. The disappointed
relations then petitioned the Irish Parliament to redress this grievance by transferring to them
the monies designed by Andrews for the Observatory. It would not be right, they contended,
that the kindly intentions of the late Provost towards his kindred should be frustrated for the
sake of maintaining what they described as “a purely ornamental institution.” The authorities
of the College protested against this claim. Counsel were heard, and a Committee of the
House made a report declaring the situation of the relations to be a hard one. Accordingly,
a compromise was made, and the dispute terminated.</p>

<p>The selection of a site for the new Astronomical Observatory was made by the Board
of Trinity College. The beautiful neighbourhood of Dublin offered a choice of excellent
localities. On the north side of the Liffey an Observatory could have been admirably placed,
either on the remarkable promontory of Howth or on the elevation of which Dunsink is
the summit. On the south side of Dublin there are several eminences that would have been
suitable: the breezy heaths at Foxrock combine all necessary conditions; the obelisk hill
at Killiney would have given one of the most picturesque sites for an Observatory in the world;
while near Delgany two or three other good situations could be mentioned. But the Board of
those pre-railway days was naturally guided by the question of proximity. Dunsink was
accordingly chosen as the most suitable site within the distance of a reasonable walk from
Trinity College.</p>

<p>The northern boundary of the Phoenix Park approaches the little river Tolka, which
winds through a succession of delightful bits of sylvan scenery, such as may be found in the
wide demesne of Abbotstown and the classic shades of Glasnevin. From the banks of the Tolka,
on the opposite side of the park, the pastures ascend in a gentle slope to culminate at Dunsink,
where at a distance of half-a-mile from the stream, of four miles from Dublin, and at a height
of 300 feet above the sea, now stands the Observatory. From the commanding position of
Dunsink a magnificent view is obtained. To the east the sea is visible, while the southern
prospect over the valley of the Liffey is bounded by a range of hills and mountains extending
from Killiney to Bray Head, thence to the Little Sugar Loaf, the Two Rock and the Three
Rock Mountains, over the flank of which the summit of the Great Sugar Loaf is just perceptible.
Directly in front opens the fine valley of Glenasmole, with Kippure Mountain, while the range
can be followed to its western extremity. The climate of Dunsink is well suited for astronomical
observation. No doubt here, as elsewhere in Ireland, clouds are abundant, but mists or haze
are comparatively unusual, and fogs are almost unknown.</p>

<p>The legal formalities to be observed in assuming occupation exacted a delay of many
months: accordingly, it was not until the 10th December, 1782, that a contract could be made
with Mr. Graham Moyers for the erection of a meridian room and a dome for an Equatorial, in
conjunction with a becoming residence for the Astronomer. Before the work was commenced at
Dunsink, the Board thought it expedient to appoint the first Professor of Astronomy. They
met for this purpose on the 22nd January, 1783, and chose the Reverend Henry Ussher, a Senior
Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin The wisdom of the appointment
was immediately shown by the assiduity with which Ussher
engaged in founding the Observatory. In three years he had
erected the buildings and equipped them with instruments, several
of which were of his own invention. On the 19th of February,
1785, a special grant of £200 was made by the Board to
Dr. Ussher as some recompense for his labours. It happened that the Observatory was
not the only scientific institution which came into being in Ireland at this period: the
newly-kindled ardour for the pursuit of knowledge led, at the same time, to the foundation
of the Royal Irish Academy. By a fitting coincidence, the first memoir published in the
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy was by the first Andrews Professor of Astronomy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
It was read on the 13th of June, 1785, and bore the title, “Account of the Observatory
belonging to Trinity College,” by the Reverend H. Ussher, D.D., M.R.I.A., F.R.S. This
communication shows the extensive design that had been originally intended for Dunsink,
only a part of which was, however, carried out. For instance, two long corridors running
north and south from the central edifice, which are figured in the paper, never developed into
bricks and mortar. We are not told why the original scheme had to be contracted; but
perhaps the reason may be not unconnected with a remark of Ussher’s, that the College had
already advanced from its own funds a sum considerably exceeding the original bequest.
A picture of the building, showing also the dome for the South Equatorial, which was
erected many years later, is given on <a href="#Page_133">page 133</a>.</p>

        </div>

<p>Ussher died in 1790. During his brief career at the Observatory, he observed eclipses,
and is stated to have done other scientific work. The minutes of the Board declare that
the infant institution had already obtained celebrity by his labours, and they urge the claims
of his widow to a pension on the ground that the disease from which he died had been
contracted by his nightly vigils. The Board also promised a grant of fifty guineas as a help
to bring out Dr. Ussher’s sermons. They advanced twenty guineas to his widow towards
the publication of his astronomical papers. They ordered his bust to be executed for the
Observatory, and offered “The Death of Ussher” as the subject of a prize essay; but, so
far as I can find, neither the sermons nor the papers, neither the bust nor the prize essay,
ever came into being.</p>

<p>There was keen competition for the Chair of Astronomy, which the death of Ussher
vacated. The two candidates were Rev. John Brinkley, of Caius College, Cambridge, a Senior
Wrangler (born at Woodbridge, Suffolk, in 1763), and Mr. Stack, Fellow of Trinity College,
Dublin, and author of a book on Optics. A majority of the Board at first supported Stack,
while Provost Hely Hutchinson and one or two others supported Brinkley. In those days the
Provost had a veto at elections, so that ultimately Stack was withdrawn, and Brinkley was
elected. This took place on the 11th December, 1790. The national press of the day
commented on the preference shown to the young Englishman, Brinkley, over his Irish rival.
An animated controversy ensued. The Provost himself condescended to enter the lists, and
to vindicate his policy by a long letter in the <cite>Public Register or Freeman’s Journal</cite>, of 21st
December, 1790. This letter was anonymous, but its authorship is obvious. It gives the
correspondence with Maskelyne and other eminent astronomers, whose advice and guidance
had been sought by the Provost. It also contends that “the transactions of the Board ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not to be canvassed in the newspapers.” For this reference, as well as for much other
information, I am indebted to my friend the Rev. John W. Stubbs, D.D.</p>

<p>The next event in the history of the Observatory was the issue of Letters Patent
(32 Geo. III., <span class="fs70">A.D.</span> 1792), in which it is recited that “We grant and ordain that there shall be for
ever hereafter a Professor of Astronomy, on the foundation of Dr. Andrews, to be called and
known by the name of the Royal Astronomer of Ireland.” The letters prescribe the various duties
of the Astronomer, and the mode of his election. They lay down regulations as to the conduct
of the astronomical work, and as to the choice of an assistant. They direct that the Provost
and Senior Fellows shall make a thorough inspection of the Observatory once every year, in
June or July; and this duty was first undertaken on the 5th of July, 1792. It will thus be
noted that the date fixed for the celebration of the Tercentenary of the University happens
to be the centenary of the first Visitation of the Observatory. The Visitors on the first
occasion were&mdash;A. Murray, Matthew Young, George Hall, and John Barrett. They record
that they find the buildings, books, and instruments in good condition; but the chief feature
in this report, as well as in many which followed it, related to a circumstance to which we
have not yet referred.</p>

<p>In the original equipment of the Observatory, Ussher, with the natural ambition of a
founder, desired to place in it a telescope of more magnificent proportions than could be
found anywhere else. The Board gave a spirited support to this enterprise, and negotiations
were entered into with the most eminent instrument-maker of those days. This was
Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800), famous as the improver of the sextant, as the constructor of the
great Theodolite used by General Roy in the English Survey, and as the inventor of the
Dividing Engine for graduating astronomical instruments. Ramsden had built for Sir George
Schuckburgh the largest and most perfect Equatorial ever attempted. He had constructed
mural quadrants for Padua and Verona, which elicited the wonder of astronomers, when Dr.
Maskelyne declared he could detect no error in their graduation as large as two seconds
and a-half. But Ramsden maintained that even better results would be obtained by superseding
the entire quadrant by the circle. He obtained the means of testing this prediction when he
completed a superb circle for Palermo of five feet diameter. Finding his anticipations were
realised, he desired to apply the same principles on a still grander scale. Ramsden was in
this mood when he met with Dr. Ussher. The enthusiasm of the Astronomer and the
instrument-maker communicated itself to the Board, and a tremendous circle, to be ten feet
in diameter, was forthwith projected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Projected, but never carried out. After Ramsden had to some extent completed a
ten-foot circle, he found such difficulties that he tried a nine-foot, and this again he
discarded for an eight-foot, which was ultimately accomplished, though not entirely by
himself. Notwithstanding the contraction from the vast proportions originally designed, the
completed instrument must still be regarded as a colossal piece of astronomical workmanship.
Even at this day I do not know that any other Observatory except Dunsink can show
a circle eight feet in diameter graduated all round.</p>

<p>I think it is Professor Piazzi Smyth who tells us how grateful he was to find a large
telescope he had ordered finished by the opticians on the very day they had promised it. The
day was perfectly correct; it was only the year that was wrong. A somewhat remarkable
experience in this direction is chronicled by the early reports of the Visitors to the Dunsink
Observatory. I cannot find the date on which the great circle was ordered from Ramsden,
but it is fixed with sufficient precision by an allusion in Ussher’s paper to the Royal Irish
Academy, which shows that by the 13th June, 1785, the order had been given, but that the
abandonment of the ten-foot scale had not then been contemplated. It was reasonable that
the Board should allow Ramsden ample time for the completion of a work at once so
elaborate and so novel. It could not have been finished in a year, nor would there have
been much reason for complaint if the maker had found he required two or even three
years more.</p>

<p>Seven years gone, and still no telescope, was the condition in which the Board found
matters at their first Visitation in 1792. They had, however, assurances from Ramsden that
the instrument would be completed within the year; but, alas for such promises! another
seven years rolled on, and in 1799 the place for the great circle was still vacant at Dunsink.
Ramsden had fallen into bad health, and the Board considerately directed that “inquiries
should be made.” Next year there was still no progress, so the Board were roused to
threaten Ramsden with a suit at law; but the menace was never executed, for the malady
of the great optician grew worse, and he died that year.</p>

<p>Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect, for the College had advanced much money
to Ramsden during these fifteen years, and the instrument was still unfinished. An appeal
was made by the Provost to Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer-Royal of England, for his
advice and kindly offices in this emergency. Maskelyne responds&mdash;in terms calculated to
allay the anxiety of the Bursar&mdash;“Mr. Ramsden has left property behind him, and the
College can be in no danger of losing both their money and the instrument.” The business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of Ramsden was then undertaken by Berge, who proceeded to finish the great circle quite
as deliberately as his predecessor. After four years Berge promised the instrument in the
following August, but it did not come. Two years later (1806) the Professor complains
that he can get no answer from Berge. In 1807 it is stated that Berge will send the
telescope in a month. He did not; but in the next year (1808), about twenty-three years
after the great circle was ordered, it was erected at Dunsink, where it is still to be seen.</p>

<p>The following circumstances have been authenticated by the signatures of Provosts,
Proctors, Bursars, and other College dignitaries:&mdash;In 1793 the Board ordered two of the clocks
at the Observatory to be sent to Mr. Crosthwaite for repairs. Seven years later, in 1800,
Mr. Crosthwaite was asked if the clocks were ready. This impatience was clearly unreasonable,
for even in four years more, 1804, we find the two clocks were still in hands. Two years
later, in 1806, the Board determined to take vigorous action by asking the Bursar to call
upon Crosthwaite. This evidently produced some effect, for in the following year, 1807, the
Professor had no doubt that the clocks would be speedily returned. After eight years
more, in 1815, one of the clocks was still being repaired, and so it was in 1816, which is the
last record we have of these interesting timepieces. Astronomers are, however, accustomed
to deal with such stupendous periods in their calculations, that even the time taken to
repair a clock seems but small in comparison.</p>

<p>The long tenure of the Chair of Astronomy by Brinkley is divided into two nearly
equal periods by the year in which the great circle was erected. Brinkley was eighteen
years waiting for his telescope, and he had eighteen years more in which to use it. During
the first of these periods Brinkley devoted himself to mathematical research; during the latter
he became a celebrated astronomer. Brinkley’s mathematical labours procured for their
author some reputation as a mathematician. They appear to be works of considerable
mathematical elegance, but not indicating any great power of original thought. Perhaps it
has been prejudicial to Brinkley’s fame in this direction that he was immediately followed
in his chair by so mighty a genius as William Rowan Hamilton.</p>

<p>After the great circle had been at last erected, Brinkley was able to begin his astronomical
work in earnest. Nor was there much time to lose. He was already 45 years old, a year older
than was Herschel when he commenced his immortal career at Slough. Stimulated by the
consciousness of having the command of an instrument of unique perfection, Brinkley loftily
attempted the very highest class of astronomical research. He resolved to measure anew
with his own eye and with his own hand the constants of aberration and of nutation. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
also strove to solve that great problem of the universe, the discovery of the distance of a
fixed star.</p>

<p>These were noble problems, and they were nobly attacked. But to appraise with justice
this work of Brinkley, done seventy years ago, we must not apply to it the same criteria as we
would think right to apply to similar work were it done now. We do not any longer use
Brinkley’s constant of aberration, nor do we now think that Brinkley’s determinations of the
star-distances were reliable. But, nevertheless, his investigations exercised a marked influence
on the progress of science: they stimulated the study of the principles on which exact
measurements were to be conducted.</p>

<p>Brinkley had another profession in addition to that of an astronomer. He was a divine.
When a man endeavours to pursue two distinct occupations concurrently, it will be equally easy
to explain why his career should be successful, or why it should be the reverse. If he succeeds,
he will, of course, exemplify the wisdom of having provided two strings to his bow. Should he
fail, it is, of course, because he has attempted to sit on two stools at once. In Brinkley’s case,
his two professions must be likened to the two strings rather than to the two stools. It is true
that his practical experience of a clerical life was very slender. He had made no attempt to
combine the routine of a parish with his labours in the Observatory. Nor do we associate a
special eminence in any department of religious work with his name. If, however, we are to
measure Brinkley’s merits as a divine by the ecclesiastical preferment which he received, his
services to theology must have rivalled his services to astronomy. Having been raised step by
step in the church, he was at last appointed to the See of Cloyne in 1826 as the successor of
Bishop Berkeley.</p>

<p>Now, though it was permissible for the Archdeacon to be also the Andrews Professor, yet
when the Archdeacon became a Bishop it was understood that he should transfer his residence
from the Observatory to the Palace. The Chair of Astronomy accordingly became vacant.
Brinkley’s subsequent career seems to have been devoted entirely to ecclesiastical matters,
and for the last ten years of his life he did not contribute a paper to any scientific society.
Arago, after a characteristic lament that Brinkley should have forsaken the pursuit of
Science for the temporal and spiritual attractions of a Bishopric, pays a tribute to the
conscientiousness of the quondam astronomer:&mdash;</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“A partir du jour ou il fut revêtu de l’episcopat, l’homme dont toute la vie avait été
consacrée jusque-là à la contemplation du firmament et à la solution des questions sublimes qui
recèlent les mouvements des astres, divorca complétement avec ces douces, avec ces entraînantes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
occupations, pour se livrer sans partage aux devoirs de sa charge nouvelle, afin d’échapper, je
suppose, à la tentation, l’ex-Directeur de l’Observatoire Royal d’Irlande, l’ex-Andrews Professor
d’Astronomie de l’Université n’avait pas même dans son palais la plus modeste lunette. On doit
la révélation de se fait presque incroyable, à l’indiscrétion d’une personne qui s’étant trouvée
chez l’évêque de Cloyne un jour d’éclipse de Lune, eut le déplaisir, faute d’instruments, de ne
pouvoir suivre la marche du phénomène qu’avec ses yeux.”</p>

<p>The good Bishop died on the 13th September, 1835. He was buried in the Chapel of
Trinity College, and a fine monument to his memory is a familiar object at the foot of the noble
old staircase of the library. The best memorial of Brinkley is his admirable book on the
<cite>Elements of Plane Astronomy</cite>. It passed through many editions in his lifetime, and even at
the present day the same work, revised first by Dr. Luby and more recently by the Rev. Dr.
Stubbs and Dr. Brünnow, has a large and well-merited circulation.</p>

<p>On the 4th August, 1805, a few years before the great circle was erected at the
Observatory, William Rowan Hamilton was born in No. 36, Dominick Street, Dublin. He
was educated by his uncle, the Rev. James Hamilton, at Trim, and his aunt, Jane Sidney
Hamilton. The astounding precocity of the child is thus described by his biographer, Mr.
Graves, to whose laborious and painstaking execution of his great task I must here make
my acknowledgments. Of William Rowan Hamilton it is asserted that, “continuing a
vigorous child in spirits and playfulness, he was, at three years of age, a superior reader
of English and considerably advanced in arithmetic; at four, a good geographer; at five,
able to read and translate Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and loving to recite Dryden, Collins,
Milton, and Homer; at eight he has added Italian and French, and given vent to his
feelings in extemporised Latin; and before he is ten he is a student of Arabic and Sanskrit.
And all this knowledge seems to have been acquired, not indeed without diligence, but
with perfect ease, and applied, as occasion arose, with practical judgment and tact.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>When Hamilton was seventeen years old (1822), he had written original mathematical
papers, and with two of these&mdash;entitled respectively, “Osculating Parabola to Curves of Double
Curvature,” and “On Contacts between Algebraic Curves and Surfaces”&mdash;he paid a visit to Dr.
Brinkley at the Observatory. The Royal Astronomer was impressed by their value, and desired
to see them in a more developed form. Thus originated an acquaintance between the scientific
veteran, soon to be a Bishop, and the brilliant lad about to enter college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>After Brinkley had been appointed Bishop of Cloyne in 1826, Hamilton was immediately
mentioned as his probable successor. Mr. Graves, to whom I am indebted for these particulars,
assures us that Hamilton never put himself forward until a week before the election, when he
received an urgent letter from his tutor, Mr. Boyton, to say that the Board were favourably
disposed towards him. On the 16th June, 1827, the undergraduate of twenty-two, William
Rowan Hamilton, was unanimously elected to the Chair of Astronomy. Nor was he without
formidable competitors. Airy was a candidate, and so were some of the Fellows of Trinity
College; yet a general approval, almost unanimous, ratified the choice of the Board. We say
almost unanimous, because there was at least one weighty opinion on the other side. Bishop
Brinkley thought that Hamilton had acted imprudently in accepting the post, and that it would
have been wiser for him to have sought a Fellowship. With Hamilton’s life before us, we
can now see that the Bishop was not right. The leisure and the seclusion of the Observatory
were necessary conditions for Hamilton’s colossal labours. After his election to the Chair of
Astronomy, Hamilton proceeded to his degree in the usual manner; but before doing so, he
had, as an undergraduate, to perform the somewhat anomalous duty of examining graduates
in the higher branches of mathematics for Bishop Law’s mathematical premium.</p>

<p>The history of Dunsink Observatory for the next 38 years may be epitomised in a single
word&mdash;Quaternions. It will be unnecessary to refer in any detail to the great career of our
great mathematician. The early promise of the marvellous child and the brilliant career
of the unparalleled student soon bore fruit in the congenial atmosphere of the Observatory.
Conical Refraction, the Theory of Rays, the general method of Dynamics&mdash;any one of these
researches would have conferred fame of which the greatest mathematician might have been
proud, but with Hamilton these were merely incidental to the great work of his life. With
huge industry he cultivated his powers, he wrought his mighty system of Quaternions, and
found in it a weapon adequate to deal with the most profound mathematical problems of
nature. It is not Hamilton’s fault if others have found that to wield this sword of a giant
the arm of the giant is also necessary. Most of us feel satisfied if we know enough to be
able to reverence the two awful volumes which every mathematician likes to see on his
shelves, and which he generally leaves there.</p>

<p>So great a personality as Hamilton has naturally gathered around itself much biographical
interest. The intimacy between Hamilton and Wordsworth has given many interesting pages
to Mr. Graves’ book, and how intimate the friendship became may be conjectured from
the account of their first meeting. We are told how Hamilton walked back with Wordsworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to see him home after a delightful evening, and how Wordsworth then turned to see Hamilton
back, and how the process was repeated I know not how often. It appears that Hamilton
submitted his poetic effusions to his friend, and they were returned with gentle criticism,
though with an occasional admission by Wordsworth that the mathematician’s verses possessed
genuine feeling. Then there is the visit of Wordsworth to Dunsink, where to this day a beautiful
shady walk bears his name. Hamilton enjoyed the privilege of intimacy with many cultivated
intellects. He knew Coleridge; with Sir John Herschel he was in frequent communication;
and he had many lady correspondents, including Maria Edgeworth. The bulk of Hamilton’s
scientific correspondence was with the late Professor De Morgan, a man whose intellectual
endowments were of such a different type to those of Hamilton, that, except in being both
mathematicians, they had but little in common. On the death of Hamilton, De Morgan
writes to Sir John Herschel (Sept. 13, 1865):&mdash;</p>

<p>“W. R. Hamilton was an intimate friend whom I spoke to once in my life&mdash;at Babbage’s
about 1830; but for 30 years we have corresponded. I <em>saw</em> him a second time at the dinner
you got at the Freemason’s when you came from the Cape, but I could not get near enough
to speak.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The Observatory had the usual equipment of a transit instrument, a circle, and an
equatorial, but no further additions were made to the instruments during the long sojourn of
Hamilton. Observations were made by the assistant, Mr. Thomson, who, after a life passed in
the service, retired in 1874, and lived a few years to enjoy the pension conferred on him by
the Board. Just before Sir W. Hamilton’s death an important donation was received by the
College. I shall here mention the circumstances under which it was made. The particulars
were related to me partly by the donor himself, and partly by the late Earl of Rosse. The
chief incidents in the narrative may be found in the life of De Morgan<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to which I have
already referred.</p>

<p>Sir James South was a medical man who acquired considerable wealth early in life, and
then devoted himself with great assiduity to astronomy. He became an expert observer, and
in conjunction with Sir John Herschel formed a series of double star measures that obtained
much fame. Honours flowed in upon South; he received a pension and a knighthood; and
he prepared for further astronomical work. His first care was to procure a superior telescope,
and from Cauchoix, a French optician of renown, he procured an object-glass 12 inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
diameter, and possessing great optical perfection. For this lens, or rather pair of lenses, he paid
either £800 or £1,000. South returned with this prize to his observatory at Campden Hill,
Kensington, and commenced to have the mounting executed in a manner befitting the optical
excellence of the lens. Brunel designed the revolving dome; it was made of mahogany, and
cost, I believe, £2,000; and inside
this building the eminent firm of
Troughton &amp; Simms were called
upon to erect the telescope. But
sad troubles followed, of which an
entertaining account is given in
De Morgan’s Life (p. 61), and the
mounting was a dismal failure.</p>

<p>Sir James South, at all events
in the later part of his career, dearly
loved a fray. He commissioned a
friend to bear a hostile message to a
distinguished scientific contemporary.
The duel never came off. Perhaps,
even if it had, the results might not
have been sanguinary, for it had been
suggested that the two astronomers
would, of course, have been placed
at telescopic distances apart. But
to those to whom he was attached
his loyalty and devotion were unbounded;
his purse and his influence
were alike at their disposal. To
these characteristics of South we owe the great equatorial telescope now at Dunsink
Observatory.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_154.jpg" width="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
SOUTH EQUATORIAL, DUNSINK.</div>
</div>

<p>The precious object-glass remained in his possession for about thirty years, until such
time as the late Earl of Rosse was installed as Chancellor of the University. The Earl
was one of Sir James’ warm friends, and he celebrated the occasion by presenting the great
object-glass to the University of Dublin. The date of the gift is 17th February, 1863.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>It was thus only a few years before Sir W. R. Hamilton’s death that Dunsink Observatory
possessed a really fine objective; but it was only an objective, it was not a telescope. The
engrossing labours of Sir W. R. Hamilton’s mathematical work, his advancing years, and his
declining health, did not permit him to undertake the arduous labour of its erection. Sir
James South found in this a sad grievance. I have heard him denounce this inaction with
that vigorous language which he was accustomed to use. He had even offered to contribute
liberally to the expenses of mounting, if the College authorities would put it in hands. It
was not, however, until Sir W. R. Hamilton’s successor was appointed (1865) that the work
was done. South lived just long enough to know that the great instrument was at last
being erected. A view of the instrument, named the South Equatorial, after the donor, is
shown in the adjoining illustration.</p>

<p>The successor of Sir William Rowan Hamilton as Andrews Professor of Astronomy
was Dr. Francis Brünnow. He was a German by birth, who had distinguished himself by
various astronomical researches, and by an excellent work on Practical Astronomy. He
had previously occupied the Chair of Astronomy at the University of Michigan. When
Brünnow came to Dunsink, his first care was the mounting of the great South Equatorial.
A building was erected on the lawn, surmounted by a dome, and fitted with revolving
machinery by Messrs. Grubb, who also constructed the tube and stand. A micrometer, from
the Berlin firm of Messrs. Pistor &amp; Martin, was added, and thus the South object-glass, forty
years after it was made, came into actual use.</p>

<p>Dr. Brünnow devoted himself chiefly to the investigation of the Parallax of Stars. In
this he was, indeed, following the traditions of the Observatory as laid down by Brinkley.
Brünnow published two parts of his researches on this difficult subject. These papers are
now regarded as a classical authority in this branch of astronomy. The pains which he took
to eliminate error, and the consummate manner in which he has discussed his results, show
him to have been both a skilful observer and an ingenious computer.</p>

<p>The fundamental equipment of the modern Observatory must include an equatorial and a
meridian circle. Dunsink was now provided with the former, but there was no meridian circle.
The great Ramsden instrument had become obsolete. The old transit had also seen more than
half-a-century of service, and could not be relied on for accurate work. A splendid meridian
circle was therefore ordered, by the liberality of the Board, from Messrs. Pistor &amp; Martin, of
Berlin. It was erected in 1872-1873, at a cost of £800. The aperture of this instrument is
6·4 inches and the length is 8 feet. The circles are divided to two-minute spaces, and read by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
eight microscopes, four on each side. The instrument can be reversed, and has north and south
collimators. The Meridian Room and the fine instrument just described are shown in the
subjoined illustration.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_156.jpg" width="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
MERIDIAN ROOM, DUNSINK.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1874 Dr. Brünnow resigned, and was succeeded by the present writer; and about
the same time Dr. Ralph Copeland was appointed assistant. In the following year Dr.
Copeland went to the Earl
of Crawford’s Observatory
at Dunecht, and he now
fills the distinguished position
of Royal Astronomer of
Scotland. Dr. Copeland was
succeeded as assistant at
Dunsink by Mr. C. E. Burton.
Failing health caused Mr.
Burton’s resignation in 1878,
and Dr. J. L. E. Dreyer then
came to Dunsink, where he
remained till the death of the
late Dr. Romney Robinson
in 1882 created a vacancy in
the post of Astronomer at
Armagh, to which Dr. Dreyer
was then appointed. His
place at Dunsink was filled
by Dr. Arthur A. Rambaut,
the present assistant.</p>

<p>Among the additions
made to the Observatory
under my direction may be mentioned an electric chronograph for recording transits. A time
service has also been in operation for many years, by which the standard mean time clock in
the Observatory controls, on Jones’ system, the Front clock and the Board-room clock in the
Port and Docks Office, Westmoreland Street, Dublin. The ball falls at this office at 1 p.m.,
Greenwich time, and the fact of falling reports itself automatically at Dunsink, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Front clock reports itself at Dunsink every minute. But the chief addition to the
Observatory in late years is the superb reflecting telescope for photographic purposes, which
is the gift of Isaac Roberts, Esq., F.R.S., of Crowborough, Sussex. This instrument has been
established in the small dome on the top of the Observatory.</p>

<p>The last chronicle of Dunsink that it may be necessary here to mention is that Sir
Robert Ball was appointed, on 20th February, 1892, to succeed Professor J. Couch Adams as
Lowndean Professor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p class="pfs80">“<em>The Books, but especially the Parchments.</em>”</p>

<p class="pfs100 lsp">THE LIBRARY.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<div><img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_159b.jpg" width="90" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">The Library had its beginning in 1601, from a subscription by the
officers and soldiers of Queen Elizabeth’s army in Ireland. Prior to
that, indeed, there were a few books; a list (dated 1600) of forty books,
ten of which were MS., has been preserved, and was printed by Dr. J. K.
Ingram in an appendix to his <cite>Address to the Library Association</cite>. It
includes&mdash;of classical authors&mdash;Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero. In 1601, however, in
order to commemorate the battle of Kinsale, in which the Spanish troops and their
Irish allies were defeated, the troops subscribed £700<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to purchase books for the newly-founded
College. “Then souldiers,” says Dr. Bernard, “were for the advancement of
learning.” Possibly; but it is significant that the money was subscribed “out of the arrears
of their pay.” However, the example, as we shall see, proved fruitful. The money was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
entrusted to Luke Challoner and James Ussher (afterwards Primate), who accordingly went
to London to make their purchases. It happened that Sir Thomas Bodley was at the same
time buying books for his library at Oxford, and he and Ussher consulted, to their mutual
advantage.</p>

<p>It may be asked, What notable books did they buy, and what prices did they pay?
As to the first, there exists a rough shelf-list of books in the Library which must have been
drawn up very soon after this. It is in Challoner’s handwriting, and shows that rarities
were not sought for, but books useful for study and research. The prices are not recorded,
but Challoner has left a list of the prices he paid for his own books a few years earlier. A
few specimens of these may be interesting. <cite>Scapulæ Lexicon</cite> cost him 12s.; a Hebrew Bible
in 4to, 16s.; an English Bible, 8vo, 6s.; <cite>Stephani Concordantiæ</cite>, 14s.; Cicero: <cite>Opera Omnia</cite>,
8vo, 6s. 8d.; Homer: <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite>, each 2s. 6d.; an 8vo <cite>Virgil</cite>, 1s. 4d.; another, in
16mo, 10d. The most expensive books are&mdash;<cite>Mercator’s Tabula</cite>, £3, and <cite>Vatablus</cite>; <cite>Biblia
Sacra</cite> (Hebrew, Greek, Latin), £3 10s. The average price was about 5s. A few years later
we find Challoner and Ussher again in London buying books for the Library. Chiefly, no
doubt, in consequence of their purchases, the number of books in 1610 was about 4,000. In
1635 the Library is already mentioned as a matter of pride to the College by Sir W.
Brereton. He specifies a MS. of Roger Bacon, which, he says, they highly esteem, considering
it to be the only copy of that great man’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opus Majus</i>. Brereton, however, professes
himself sceptical, on the ground that the MS. is so very clean and newly bound. How the
latter fact could militate against the antiquity of the MS. is not very clear. Brereton also
pronounces the Library to be not well furnished with books. The building, too, he reports
as not large or well contrived.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>It was, however, at the Restoration that the Library was at once raised to the first
class, at least as regards MSS., by the accession of Archbishop Ussher’s library. The
fortunes of this were rather remarkable. During the rebellion of 1641 it was in Drogheda,
the seat of the Archiepiscopal residence, where it was in great peril of destruction, that place
being besieged for four months. Shortly after the raising of the siege it was transferred to
Chester, and subsequently to Chelsea College. Here, however, it was not much safer than
in Ireland, for the Archbishop having preached against the authority of the Assembly of
Divines, the House of Commons confiscated his library, the severest punishment they had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in their power to inflict. Happily, there were two men in the Assembly of nobler sentiments&mdash;Dr.
Featley, formerly chaplain to Archbishop Abbot, and the learned John Selden.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> By
Selden’s help, Dr. Featley either obtained a grant of the library or was enabled to purchase
it for a small sum, and so preserved it for the Primate; but part had already been
embezzled.</p>

<p>When Ussher was appointed by the Benchers preacher at Lincoln’s Inn, apartments
were appropriated to his use, in which he was able to place his library, or rather pack up
as much of it as remained. It was his intention to bequeath it to Trinity College, as a
token of gratitude to the place where he had received his education; but having lost all
his other property in the disturbances of the time, he was obliged to give up this purpose
and to leave it to his daughter, Lady Tyrrell, wife of Sir Timothy Tyrrell. Ussher died
in 1656. The library was famous, and Parr, in his <cite>Life of Ussher</cite>, states that “the King
of Denmark and Cardinal Mazarin endeavoured to obtain it, offering a good price through
their agents in England; but Cromwell having, by an Order in Council, prohibited its being
sold without his consent, it was bought by the soldiers and officers of the then army in
Ireland, who, out of emulation to the previous noble action of Queen Elizabeth’s army, were
incited by some men of publick spirits to the like performance, and they had it for much
less than it was really worth, or what had been offered for it before by the agents above-mentioned
[viz., for £2,200]; they had also with it all his manuscripts (which were not of his
own handwriting), as also a choice, though not numerous, collection of ancient coins. But when
this library was brought over into Ireland, the usurper and his son, who then commanded
in chief there, would not bestow it on the Colledge of Dublin, least perhaps the gift should
not appear so considerable as it would do by itself; and therefore they gave out that they
would reserve it for a new Colledge or Hall which they said they intended to build and
endow; but it proved that as those were not times, so they were not persons capable of
any such noble or pious work; so that this library lay in the Castle of Dublin unbestowed
and unemployed all the remaining time of Cromwell’s usurpation; but where this treasure
was kept being left open, many of the books and most of the best manuscripts were stolen
away or else imbezled (<em>sic</em>) by those who were intrusted with them; but after his late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Majesty’s Restauration, when they fell to his disposal, he generously bestowed them on the
Colledge for which they were intended by the owner, where they now remain.”</p>

<p>Dr. Parr’s account may perhaps require to be modified by comparison with the
following document:&mdash;“June 29, 1659.&mdash;The Commissioners of Parliament for the Government
of Ireland referred to ‘certain persons named’ to take a view of the gallery at Cork
House and the armory-room near the Castle, and to consider with workmen which place
may be most convenient for placing Dr. Ussher’s Library, and to present an estimate of
the charge for making Presses and Chains for the Books in order to their use and security.”
On 1st November following it was ordered “that the Trustees for Trinity College, as also
Dr. Watson, Dr. Gorges, and Mr. Williamson, be desired to attend the Board and to
consider together how the Library formerly belonging to Dr. Ussher, purchased by the
State and army, may be disposed and fitted for Publick use. And also to take into consideration
a Letter from Dr. Berners [query, Bernard], as also a Paper delivered by Dr.
Jones, concerning the publishing of some part of the said Library or manuscripts, and of
recovering some part of the said Library being at present abroad in some men’s hands,
albeit they ought to have been returned hither with the Books as were purchased, or such
only as were sent hither and are in the custody of Mr. Williamson or others. And to
inform themselves in what condition the said Library at present is. Whether since the
coming of the said Books hither any of them have been lent out or otherwise disposed of&mdash;to
whom, when, and by whose order, with what else may concern the Business.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>With respect to the part which the King had in sending the books to the College,
Dr. Ingram seems to suspect that Dr. Parr’s “effusively loyal spirit led him erroneously to
attribute this act of restitution to Charles II. His Majesty’s consent,” he adds, “would
perhaps be formally necessary, but it seems to have been really the Irish House of
Commons that moved in the matter. In the Journals of the House under that date, 31
Maii, 1661, appears an order ‘that the Vice-Chancellor and Provost of the College of
Dublin, and Mr. Richard Lingard, with such others as they will take to their assistance,
be decreed and are hereby empowered, with all convenient speed, to cause the Library
formerly belonging to the late Lord Primate of Armagh, and purchased by the army, to be
brought from the Castle of Dublin, where they now are, into the said College, there to be
preserved for public use; and the said persons are likewise to take a catalogue of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
said Library, both manuscripts and printed books, and to deliver the same into this House, to
be inserted in the Journals of the House.’”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I may add that in the catalogue of MSS. drawn
up by George Browne (afterwards Provost) in 1688 (and printed by Dr. Bernard in his <cite>Catalogus
Manuscriptorum Angliæ et Hiberniæ</cite>), these MSS. are stated to have been given by the
“Conventus generalis habitus Dublinii an. 1666.” It seems probable, too, that Dr. Parr has
somewhat exaggerated the losses from the Library when he says that most of the MSS.
were lost. As far as we can judge in the absence of a catalogue earlier than the Restoration,
the best MSS. would seem to be still in the collection. It still contains, happily, the
most beautiful book in the world, to be presently described more particularly.</p>

<p>In 1671 the Countess of Bath, whose husband, Henry Bourchier, had been a Fellow,
presented a collection of books purchased for the express purpose, some of them handsomely
bound, and with her arms on the sides. Dr. Ingram has quoted from the <cite>Life and Errors</cite>
of John Dunton an interesting notice of the Library in 1704. From this we learn that
there was nothing to distinguish the building externally; “it is,” says he, “over the scholars’
lodgings, the length of one of the quadrangles, and contains a great many choice books of
great value, particularly one, the largest I ever saw for breadth; it was an Herbal, containing
the lively portraitures of all sorts of Trees, Plants, Herbs, and Flowers.” The Library at
that time served as a Museum as well, for he says that he was shown in the same place
“the skin of a notorious Tory which had been tanned and stuffed with straw.” This
interesting relic does not now exist, which is not surprising, considering the state of
dilapidation in which it was at the time of Dunton’s visit.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Not very long after Dunton’s
visit the foundation stone of the present Library was laid (1712), the House of Commons
having granted considerable sums for the purpose. It was completed in 1732. The print on
next page, dated 1753, gives an illustration of this building as it then appeared. In the
interim we obtain an unsatisfactory glimpse of the state of things in a letter from Berkeley,
then a Fellow, which mentions that the Library “is at present so old and ruinous and the
books so out of order that there is little attendance given.”</p>

<p>The new building speedily received large accessions of books. In 1726 Dr. William
Palliser, Archbishop of Cashel, bequeathed to the College all such books and editions in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
library as the College did not already possess. This gift amounted to about four thousand
volumes. He made it a condition that these books should always be kept next to those of
Archbishop Ussher.</p>

<p>A still greater benefactor to the Library was Dr. Claudius Gilbert, who had been
Vice-Provost and Professor of Divinity. In forming his library he had in view the purpose
of presenting it to the College, and applied great knowledge and judgment to the selection
of books. His collection, the fruit of many years of such care, contained nearly thirteen
thousand volumes, many of them early and rare texts. His bust was placed near the books
in 1758.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
OLD PRINT OF LIBRARY, 1753.</div>
</div>

<p>Nearly at the same time as Gilbert’s gift, the MS. collection was largely augmented
by the bequest of Dr. John Stearne, Bishop of Clogher and Vice-Chancellor of the
University. This collection included that of Dr. John Madden (President of the College of
Physicians), a catalogue of which was printed in Dr. Bernard’s <cite>Catalogus Manuscriptorum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Angliæ et Hiberniæ</cite>. Amongst the MSS. thus acquired was the collection in thirty-two
folio volumes of the Depositions of the Sufferers by the Rising in 1641. These records had
been in the custody of Matthew Barry, Clerk of the Council, and at his death were purchased
by Dr. John Madden, at the sale of whose books they were purchased by Dr. Stearne.
From the same collection we obtained a considerable number of letters and other documents
relating to military and judicial proceedings in Ireland, especially from 1647 to 1679.</p>

<p>In 1786 there was added to the Library an extremely valuable collection of Irish
(Celtic) books formerly belonging to the celebrated Edward Lhuyd,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> at whose death they
were purchased by Sir John Sebright. At the suggestion of Edmund Burke, Sir John
presented the books to Trinity College in 1786. They include <cite>Brehon Law Commentaries</cite>,
the <cite>Book of Leinster</cite>, and other important volumes.</p>

<p>A large and valuable acquisition was made in 1802, when the Library of M. Greffier
Fagel, Pensionary of Holland, consisting of more than 20,000 volumes, was purchased by
the Board of Erasmus Smith and presented to the College. The books had been removed
to England for sale in 1794, when the French invaded Holland, and had been advertised by
Mr. Christie for sale by auction March 1, 1802, and twenty-nine following days.</p>

<p>In 1805 a very choice collection of books, including many <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Editiones Principes</i>, as
well as books remarkable for the beauty of their printing or their binding, was bequeathed
by Henry George Quin. In this collection are found some splendid specimens of printing
and binding which will be mentioned by-and-by. In more recent times, also, we have
received some valuable and interesting donations. In 1854, the <cite>Book of Armagh</cite>, a MS. of
singular interest (to be referred to more particularly hereafter), was purchased for £300 by
the Rev. W. Reeves, afterwards Bishop of Down and Connor. As he could not afford to
retain the book himself, and only desired that it should be in safe custody in our Library,
he parted with it for the same sum to the Archbishop of Armagh, Lord John George
Beresford, who presented it to Trinity College.</p>

<p>In the same year Dr. Charles Wm. Wall, Vice-Provost, purchased, through Rev. Dr.
Gibbings, several volumes of the original Records of the Inquisition at Rome, which had
been removed to Paris by Napoleon I. Extracts from these have been published by Dr.
Gibbings.</p>

<p>Amongst more recent benefactors to the Library the Rev. Aiken Irvine and Dr.
Neilson Hancock deserve to be noticed, the former of whom bequeathed about 1,000 volumes,
and the latter about 250, in 1881 and 1885 respectively. Space forbids the enumeration of
less important donations.</p>

<p>The College authorities, meanwhile, were liberal in granting money for the purchase
of books. Between November, 1805, and March, 1806, we find them giving fifty guineas
for the <cite>Complutensian Polyglot</cite>, sixty-two for Prynne’s <cite>Records</cite>, and twenty-two and a-half
for the first folio Shakespeare. Again, in the first six months of 1813 we find £126
spent on purchases at auctions, including some fifteenth-century books, and an Icelandic
Bible which cost £14 15s. 9d. In addition to these purchases, the booksellers’ bills paid
amounted to £230. Coming to a later period, we find for the ten years commencing with
1846 the average annual expenditure on purchases and binding was £668. After 1856,
however, it was found necessary to contract the expenditure. The fixed sum now set apart
annually for these purposes is £400. Extra grants are, however, made occasionally for
special purchases. As the expense of the personal staff has considerably increased, the
whole expenditure on the Library is larger than in 1856, and now amounts to about £2,000.
The expense of administration may appear out of proportion to the amount available for
the purchase of books. This is accounted for by the fact that English publications are
received without cost.</p>

<p>The chief source of the growth of the Library in the present century has been the
privilege granted by Act of Parliament in 1801&mdash;viz., the right to a copy of every book
(including every “sheet of letterpress”) published in the United Kingdom. This privilege
this Library shares with the British Museum, the Bodleian, that of Cambridge University,
and the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> To the British Museum publishers are obliged
to send their publications unasked; the other Libraries forfeit their right to any book not
claimed by them within twelve months of publication. Accordingly, they jointly employ
an agent in London for the purpose of claiming and forwarding books. The principal firms,
however, send their publications as a matter of course, without waiting to be asked.</p>

<p>This obligation cannot be thought to be a grievance to authors and publishers, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
we reflect to what an extent authors, and therefore publishers, are dependent on the resources
of these Libraries. What work of research could be produced without the aid they give?
We benefit by the generosity of our forefathers; we are only asked to hand on the torch and
help to do for posterity what antiquity has done for us. A money grant, however satisfactory
to the Libraries, would not accomplish the same public end, namely, the preservation
of the literature of the time, independently of the particular tastes or predilections of the
successive librarians. Even in the case of very expensive works, of which only a small
number of copies is issued, publishers take the obligation into account, and the result is a
relatively slight increase of price not felt by the purchasers of such works.</p>

<p>The number of printed books in the Library in 1792 was about 46,000. In 1844 it
had risen to 96,000, a large part of the increase being due to the acquisition of the Fagel
Library. When the books were last counted (August, 1891), the printed books numbered
222,648, the MSS. 1,938, giving a total of 224,586. It should be remembered that we
count volumes, not separate publications, hence a volume containing say thirty pamphlets
counts only as one book. Many of the older volumes contain two or more books of
considerable size bound in one.</p>

<p class="drop-capx">This may suffice for the history of the Library: I now proceed to speak of its
contents. If precedence is given to antiquity, the first objects to claim our
attention are the Egyptian papyri. These were presented by Lord Kingsborough
about 1838, and a catalogue of them was published by Dr. Edward Hincks. One
of these is very finely embellished with pictures representing the history of a departed soul;
several resemble the corresponding pictures in the papyrus of Ani, of which a fac-simile was
recently published by the British Museum. Some of the pictures wanting in this (our)
papyrus are supplied in others of the collection, such as the weighing of the soul, the
ploughing, sowing, and reaping in the fields of Elysium.</p>

<p>It is, chronologically, a great step from these Egyptian MSS. to the oldest of our
Greek and Latin MSS. Of Greek Biblical MSS. we have indeed few, but two of these
are of considerable importance. One is the celebrated palimpsest codex of St. Matthew’s
Gospel, known amongst Biblical critics as Z. The original text of this, in a beautiful large
uncial character, was written not later than the sixth century. But at a later date (about
the 13th century) this ancient writing was partially erased, and extracts from some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Greek Fathers written over it. The old writing was detected by Dr. John Barrett, formerly
Librarian, who published the text in what was called “engraved fac-simile,” which gives a
very correct idea of the original writing, although the form of each individual letter may not
always be exactly represented. Dr. Barrett added a learned dissertation on both the more
ancient and the later contents of the MS. Dr. Tregelles, with the help of chemical
applications, was enabled to read some letters which had escaped Dr. Barrett, and he
published an account of his discoveries in a quarto tract. He also entered his new readings
in a copy of Barrett’s work. Strange to say, these two records of Tregelles differed
considerably, and accordingly, when the present writer undertook to re-edit Barrett’s text
with Tregelles’ additions, he found it necessary to examine the MS. throughout. In so
doing, he was able to read several hundred letters and marks (such as marks of quotation,
numbers of sections and canons, etc.) which had escaped both Barrett and Tregelles, besides
correcting a few errors. The additions and corrections were made on Barrett’s plates, and
the new edition was published in 1880.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>There is also a palimpsest fragment of Isaiah, apparently of somewhat earlier date, of
which a lithographed fac-simile was included in the volume just mentioned. This fac-simile
enabled Dr. Ceriani, of Milan, to identify the recension to which a certain group of MSS.
of the Septuagint belongs.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Of the Gospels, there is a copy (63) in a cursive hand of the tenth century
with scholia. Under a portrait of St. Matthew is traceable a palimpsest fragment of a
Greek Evangelistarium. There was anciently another copy of the Gospels (64), which,
however, was reported missing in 1742. Most probably it had been lent to Bulkeley (a
Fellow), who in fact collated it for Mill. It is now in the library of the Marquis of Bute.</p>

<p>Another important though not very ancient MS. of the New Testament is the
celebrated <cite>Codex Montfortianus</cite>, historically notable as being pretty certainly the actual
MS. on whose authority the verse <span class="fs70">I</span> John v. 7 was admitted into Erasmus’ third
edition, and thence into the received text. It is not older than the fifteenth century. A
collation of the text of the Epistles is given by Barrett in his volume, <cite>Codex Rescriptus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
S. Matthæi</cite>. Dr. Orlando Dobbin in 1854 devoted a volume to the MS., giving a complete
collation of the Gospels and Acts. According to his researches, the text of the Epistles
is copied from a MS. in Lincoln College, Oxford, the verse <span class="fs70">I</span> John v. 7 being interpolated
by the copyist.</p>

<p>This manuscript has the distinction that we know the names of nearly every person
through whose hands it passed. On folio 56 is the note, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sum Thomae Clementis, olim
fratris Froyhe</i>,” and on a leaf at the end is “Mayster Wyllams, of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Christi</i>....”
After Clement it came into the possession of William Chark, from him to Dr. Thomas
Montfort, and then to Ussher. Professor Rendel Harris, in his book on “The Origin of
the Leicester Codex,” has discussed the history of the Montfort Codex. He makes the
suggestion that Froyhe is an error for Roye, the accidental repetition of a letter changing
“<em>fratris</em> Roye” into “<em>fratris</em> Froye” or “Froyhe.” There is proof that the MS.
was in Franciscan hands (the names Ἰησους, Μαρία, ϕρἀγκωκος, are scribbled in it more
than once). Barrett, for example, shows that Williams was a Franciscan, and <em>frater</em> Froyhe,
or Roye, was probably of the same order. Now there was a very remarkable member of
the Franciscan order, named William Roye, educated at Cambridge, who, however, in 1524,
forsook the order, and joined Tyndale at Hamburg. It is not impossible that the codex in
question was actually written by him. These, with a fragment (14th century) of the Epistle
to the Romans, and a small Psalter dated 1533, exhaust our Greek Biblical manuscripts.</p>

<p>Of Latin Biblical manuscripts we have a considerable number, including several
remarkable either for their text or their artistic execution. The most important for its
text is that classed A. 4, 15, and called <cite>Codex Usserianus</cite>; a manuscript of the Gospels
written probably in the sixth century, and exhibiting an old Latin text of the
Hiberno-British Recension. It is defective at the beginning and the end; every leaf also
is mutilated, so that no line remains complete. With the exception of a rude cross at
the end of St. Luke’s Gospel, there is no attempt at ornament. Here and there are
interlinear glosses scratched as with a needle point&mdash;as, for example, in reference to the
paralytic who was “borne of four,” the four are interpreted as the four evangelists. It is
remarkable that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pericopa de adultera</i> is given in a text agreeing with the Vulgate.
From this we may conclude&mdash;first, that the passage was not in the archetype; secondly,
that the scribe had a copy of the Vulgate at hand; and thirdly, that it was from choice,
not from necessity, that he copied the old Latin. The full text of this manuscript was
published in <cite>Evangelia Ante-hieronymiana</cite>. Its history is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Another MS., called <cite>The Garland of Howth</cite>, exhibits in St. Matthew’s Gospel a
similar text, but elsewhere the Vulgate, or, in some parts, a mixed text. It is probably
not earlier than the ninth century, or perhaps the tenth. Pictures of two of the evangelists
remain&mdash;the others are lost. The MS. is coarsely written, and on very coarse parchment.
The omissions in it, chiefly from homœoteleuton, are frequent and instructive. Some of
the scribe’s blunders are curious. Thus, Matthew xxii. 42, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid vobis videtur de operibus
fidelis,</span>” for “de χρο cuius filius;” Mark ii. 3, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui iiii rotis portabatur;</span>” xi. 12, “a bethania
cum x essurivit ii;” xiv. 50, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">discipuli omnes relinquentes eum cruci[fi]xerunt.</span>” In Matthew
xxvii. 5, an Irish gloss has got into the text&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">proiectis arcadgabuth c.,</span>” for “argenteis.” In
Luke xxiii. 12 another gloss appears in the text&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus malum malos in unum coniungunt.</span>”</p>

<p>Remarkable both for text and ornament is the <cite>Book of Durrow</cite> (so called from Durrow,
in King’s County, where St. Columba founded a monastery), a MS. of the Gospels (with
the prologues, &amp;c.), written perhaps in the seventh century. The text is a tolerably pure
Vulgate. The colophon contains a prayer that whoever shall hold the book in his hand
may remember the writer, Columba, who wrote this Gospel in the space of twelve days.
There were many Columbas besides the Saint, and it is pretty certain that the present book
was not written by Saint Columba. It is morally certain also that it was not written in
twelve days. But there is good reason to believe that the scribe has merely copied the
colophon from the book he was transcribing,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and if so, the archetype may have been written
by Saint Columba, who has the reputation of being a scribe.</p>

<p>Except at the beginning of each Gospel, the only attempt at ornament is a series of
red dots round the initial letters; but the letters of the first words of each Gospel are
elaborately embellished in the characteristic Celtic style. Prefixed also to each Gospel is a
page covered with interlaced ornament of great beauty, as well as another page with the
symbol of the Evangelist. These pages have been represented in fac-simile (admirably as
regards the tracing, but not with accurate reproduction of the colours) in Prof. Westwood’s
<cite>Fac-similes of Irish and Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts</cite>. The volume was formerly enclosed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a silver cover, which has long since disappeared; but a note in the book (written in 1677)
gives the inscription, which stated that the cover was made by Flann, son of Mailsechnal,
King of Ireland (who died in the year 916).<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>This MS. was presented to the Library by Henry Jones, Bishop of Meath, Vice-Chancellor
(1646 to 1660), the same whose gift of stairs, etc., to the Library in 1651 is
commemorated on a brass plate just inside the door.</p>

<p>Conall MacGeoghegan relates of Saint Columba, “hee wrote 300 bookes with his one
[own] hand, they were all new testaments, left a book to each of his churches in the
kingdome w<sup>ch</sup> Bookes sunck to the bottom of the Deepest waters, they would not lose one
letter signe or character of them, w<sup>ch</sup> I have seen partly my selfe of that book of them w<sup>ch</sup>
is at Dorow, in the K<sup>s</sup> County, for I did see the Ignorant man that hath the same in
his custody, when sickness came upon cattle, for their Remedi putt water on the booke and
suffered it to rest there a while and saw alsoe cattle returne thereby to their former or
pristinate and the book to receave noe loss.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In earlier times, indeed, even in England, the
scrapings of these Celtic manuscripts were believed to have medicinal virtues.</p>

<p>The <cite>Book of Durrow</cite> is far surpassed in beauty by the <cite>Book of Kells</cite>, so called from
Kells in Co. Meath, in which monastery it had been preserved and doubtless written. This
is also a MS. of the Gospels containing a mixed text, <em>i.e.</em>, the Vulgate modified by additions,
etc., from the old Latin. No words can convey an adequate idea of the beauty of this MS.
This does not consist, as in some Oriental MSS., in a profusion of gilding&mdash;there is no gold
whatever&mdash;nor in the addition of paintings independent of the text, but in the lavish variety
of artistic adornment applied to the letters of the text, which justifies Professor Westwood
in calling it “the most beautiful book in the world.” The ornament consists largely of ever-varying
interlacing of serpents and of simple bands, with countless spirals alternately
expanding and contracting in the peculiar “trumpet-shaped pattern.” The initial of every
sentence throughout the Gospels is an artistic product, some of them exquisite, and no two
precisely the same. In addition to this decoration, which adorns every page, there are many
pages (about thirty) entirely full of ornament, showing the utmost skill and accuracy in
almost microscopic detail. In fact, the detail is so minute that it often requires a lens to
trace it; yet these minute lines are as firm as if drawn by a machine, and as free as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a><br /><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
were the growth of nature. The exquisite harmony of the colouring is as admirable as the
elegance of the tracery. Little wonder that it was said to have been written at the dictation
of an angel. “If you look closely,” says Giraldus Cambrensis, “and penetrate to the secrets
of the art, you will discover such delicate and subtile lines, so closely wrought, so twisted
and interwoven, and adorned with colours still so fresh, that you will acknowledge that all
this is the work rather of angelic than of human skill. The more frequently and carefully
I examine it, I am always amazed with new beauties, and always discover things more and
more admirable.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Some pages originally left blank contain charters in the Irish language,
conveying grants of lands to the Abbey of Kells, the Bishop of Meath, the Monastery of
Ardbraccan, by Melaghlyn, King of Meath, and other monarchs in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries.</p>

A PAGE FROM THE BOOK OF KELLS.</div>
</div>

<p>There are fine examples of the same school of Art in English Libraries, especially
the <cite>Book of Lindisfarne</cite>, in the British Museum; the <cite>Book of St. Chad</cite>, in Lichfield, the
writing in which is extremely like that in the <cite>Book of Kells</cite>; the <cite>Gospels of MacRegol</cite>, in
the Bodleian; and the <cite>Gospels of MacDurnan</cite>, in Lambeth. Of these Irish and Hiberno-Saxon
works Dr. Wangen says:&mdash;“The ornamental pages, borders, and initial letters
exhibit such a rich variety of beautiful and peculiar designs, so admirable a taste in the
arrangement of the colours, and such an uncommon perfection of finish, that one feels
absolutely struck with amazement.” None of these, however, equals the <cite>Book of Kells</cite> in the
number, the fulness, or the perfection of detail of the great pictorial pages, while the
prodigality with which ornament is bestowed on every page and every paragraph is a feature
peculiar to it.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the <cite>Book of Kells</cite> itself to indicate its date, the last leaf&mdash;which
may have contained the name of the scribe&mdash;being lost. The <cite>Book of Lindisfarne</cite> contains
a note (of the tenth century) naming the scribe and the illuminator, the former being
Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne (died 721), and the latter his successor in the See, Aethelwald
(died 737 or 740). MacRiagoil, scribe, and Abbot of Birr (King’s County), died in 820.
The <cite>Gospels of MacDurnan</cite> appear from the character of the writing to be coeval with the
<cite>Book of Armagh</cite>, which is known to have been written in 807. From a comparison of the
<cite>Book of Kells</cite> with these MSS., it may be inferred that it belongs to the eighth century.</p>

<p>The volume was anciently enclosed in a golden cover, and the <cite>Annals of the Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Masters</cite> record, under the year 1006, that in that year it was stolen from the Church of
Kells, and was found after twenty nights and two months with its gold stolen off and a sod
over it. It is in that passage called the great Gospel of Columbkille&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, St. Columba. It
owes that name, probably, to its connection with Columba’s Monastery at Kells, where, no doubt,
it was written, and where it remained until the dissolution of the monasteries. From Richard
Plunket, the last Abbot, it passed to one Gerald Plunket, and from him to Ussher.</p>

<p>A very interesting and important MS. is the <cite>Book of Armagh</cite>, containing the entire
New Testament (in Latin), being the only complete copy which has come down to us from
the ancient Irish Church. In it the Gospels are followed immediately by St. Paul’s Epistles,
including the fictitious Epistle to the Laodiceans. It contains also memoirs of St. Patrick,
with his Confession, and a Life of St. Martin of Tours, by Sulpicius Severus. The name
of the scribe was written in several places, but in every instance has been more or less
effectually erased. However, the Bishop of Limerick (Dr. Charles Graves) succeeded in
deciphering it sufficiently to identify the name as Ferdomnach. But there were several
scribes of that name, and how to decide which was the one in question? Dr. Graves found
another note, only partly legible, and that with extreme difficulty, which appeared to have
contained the name Ferdomnach, with the words, “dictante herede Patricii &mdash;&mdash;bach.”
“Heres Patricii” was the title of the Archbishop of Armagh. The only one who satisfied
the conditions of time, and whose name ended in “bach,” was Torbach, who only occupied
the See for one year. In this way the actual year in which the MS. was written was
determined&mdash;viz., <span class="fs70">A.D.</span> 807.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Prof. Westwood thinks the same scribe wrote the Gospels of
MacDurnan, now at Lambeth. There is a note of later date in the volume relating
to certain privileges of the Church of Armagh, and written “in the presence of Brian,
imperator Scotorum”&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>, Brian Boru, who visited Armagh in 1004 and 1006, and died 1014.
The writer of this note calls himself Calvus Perennis&mdash;a Latin rendering of his name,
Maolsuthain.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> He was Brian’s private confessor. The book was in high esteem, being
regarded as the actual writing of St. Patrick, and called the <cite>Canon of Patrick</cite>. Oaths taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
upon it were considered peculiarly obligatory, and the violation of such an oath brought on
him the vengeance of the Saint, as well as extreme civil penalties. The book was entrusted
to the care of a hereditary keeper, whose family derived their name, “Maor” or “Moyre,”
from the office, to which, moreover, an endowment of land was attached. The book remained
in the possession of this family until the end of the seventeenth century, when, having been
pawned by the keeper, it came by purchase into the hands of Arthur Brownlow, from whose
lineal representative it was bought, as above related, by Rev. Dr. Reeves.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> An interesting
object connected with the <cite>Book of Armagh</cite> is its leather satchel, finely embossed with
figures of animals and interlaced work. It is formed of a single piece of leather, 36 in. long
and 12½ broad, folded so as to make a flat-sided pouch, 12 in. high, 12¾ broad, and 2¼
deep. Part of it is doubled over to make a flap, in which are eight brass-bound slits,
corresponding to as many brass loops projecting from the case, in which ran two rods,
meeting in the middle, where they were secured by a lock. In early times, in Irish
monastic libraries, books were kept in such satchels, which were suspended by straps from
hooks in the wall. Thus it is related in an old legend that “on the night of Longaradh’s
death all the book satchels in Ireland fell down.”</p>

by Donnchadh, son of Flann. This was doubtless a metal case. The satchel was clearly
not made for it.</p>

<p>We have seen that the ancient cases of the Books of Kells and Durrow were
lost long since. Two such shrines (“cumdachs”) are in our Library&mdash;one enclosing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<cite>Book of Dimma</cite>, the other the <cite>Book of Mulling</cite> or <em>Moling</em>. These books are named from
their scribes, who, according to the <cite>Annals</cite>, lived in the seventh century. Both these are
copies of the Gospels; both, however, contain also a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Missa Infirmorum</i> of later date.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The
case of the <cite>Book of Dimma</cite> is of silver, beautifully wrought with Celtic tracery. It bears an
inscription which runs as follows:&mdash;“Tatheus O’Kearbuill beideev meipsum deauravit,
dominus domnaldus O Cuanain converbius ultimo meipsum restauravit, Tomas Ceard dachorig
in mindsa.” Thady O’Carroll Boy was Prince of Ely in the middle of the twelfth century;
Donald O’Cuanain was Bishop of Killaloe from 1230 to 1260.</p>

<p>The ends of the case are obviously more ancient, apparently much more ancient, than
the sides. It will be observed that the inscription says nothing about the original maker of
the case.</p>

<p>This book, long kept in the monastery at Roscrea, disappeared at the dissolution of
the monasteries, and is said to have been found again in 1789 by boys hunting rabbits in
Devil’s Bit Mountains in Tipperary. The boys tore off part of the silver plate, and picked
out some of the lapis lazuli.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The MS. was purchased from Sir W. Betham by the College
for £200.</p>

<p>The case or shrine of the <cite>Book of Mulling</cite> appears to have been originally plain,
except for some small pieces of crystal and lapis lazuli inserted on one side. In 1402, however,
a very large crystal set in fine niello work was inserted in the same side. In 1891,
thinking I saw trace of a letter under this crystal, I raised it, and thereby revealed a brass
plate hitherto concealed by dust, and bearing the inscription: “<span class="antiqua">Artturus | ver domin | us &amp;
lageniae | rinsdabe | tilia &amp; baroni | anno &amp; dni | millio | quadrin | gentesi | mo sedo |</span>.” This Arthur
was Arthur or Art MacMurrough Kavanagh, who opposed Richard II. This inscription, no
doubt, has reference to the insertion of the crystal and the niello work, not to the original
construction of the case. This MS. also contains a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Missa Infirmorum</i> (published by Bishop
Forbes with that in the <cite>Book of Dimma</cite>).</p>

<p>Another beautiful Latin MS. of Irish origin is the <cite>Psalter of Ricemarch</cite>, so called
because it was formerly in the possession of that prelate (Bishop of St. David’s, d. 1099),
who has written in it some Latin verses. It is perhaps not much older than his time. The
book was the property of Bishop Bedell, whose autograph it bears, and was lent by him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Archbishop Ussher, and to this circumstance it owes its preservation, Bedell’s library having
been destroyed in the troubles of the time.</p>

<p>The last of these Latin Biblical MSS. which I shall mention is not Irish, but is
somewhat of a curiosity. It is a single leaf of the <cite>Codex Palatinus</cite>, a fifth-century MS.
of the old Latin version of the Gospels written in silver letters on purple vellum. The rest
of the MS. (so far as it has been preserved) is in the Imperial Library at Vienna, which
acquired it at some unknown period between 1800 and 1829. Our leaf was purchased by
Dr. Todd in 1843. It is not improbable that the MS. was abstracted from some monastic
library during the Napoleonic wars, and that this leaf, becoming separated from the rest,
came into the hands of an Irish soldier. This dispersion of a MS. is less unusual than
might be supposed. The <cite>Book of Leinster</cite>, to be presently mentioned, furnishes a notable
example.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> I recently received from a correspondent two leaves of a Syriac MS., which, by
the help of Wright’s catalogue, Dr. Gwynn identified as two of the missing leaves of a
MS. in the British Museum, the MS. having been imperfect when purchased for that
Library.</p>

<p>The <cite>Book of Hymns</cite> (11th century) deserves mention both for the beauty of its initial
letters and for the interest of its contents. Some of the hymns are Latin, some Gælic;
the greater part of both has been published by the Irish Archæological Society, with learned
notes by Dr. Todd, and with reproductions of the initial letters. The remainder of the
Gælic hymns has been published by Dr. Whitley Stokes in his <cite>Goidilica</cite>.</p>

<p>I may appropriately mention here a remarkable Pontifical formerly belonging to the
Church of Canterbury, and, as Bishop Reeves remarked to me, probably “contrectatus
manibus S. Thomae de Becket.” In this the sentence of ordination of priests is in the old
form, and in the margin is added, in a much later hand, the new form as adopted by the
Church of Rome before the Reformation, and retained in our Ordinal.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>In Celtic literature we are tolerably rich. Part of our collection came to us, as already
mentioned, by gift from Sir John Sebright, who had purchased the books at Edward Lhuyd’s
sale. Amongst these is the <cite>Book of Leinster</cite>, a large folio of about the twelfth century, of
very varied contents&mdash;historical, romantic, genealogical, and hagiological. The entire text has
been published in lithographed fac-simile at the joint expense of Trinity College and the
Royal Irish Academy, with a preface by Professor R. Atkinson. When this MS. was
presented to our Library, eleven leaves were missing. These were found, however, and
identified by Dr. Todd, in the Monastery of St. Isidore in Rome, whither they had gone
from the Irish College in Louvain. They are now deposited in the Franciscan Monastery
in Dublin.</p>

<p>The history of the <cite>Book of Lecain</cite> or <em>Leacan</em>, another important Irish MS., forms a
curious counterpart to that of the <cite>Book of Leinster</cite>. The former was included in Ussher’s
collection, and was in our Library in 1688 when the catalogue was compiled. It is there
recorded, however, that nine leaves were wanting. It is stated by Nicolson (<cite>Irish Historical
Library</cite>, p. 39), on the authority of Dr. Raymond, that the book was lodged in Paris by
Sir John Fitzgerald in the time of James II. If so, this must have been very soon after
the catalogue was compiled. In 1787, through the Abbé Kearney of Paris, it was sent to
the Royal Irish Academy, then recently founded, and in their Library it is now preserved.
The nine missing folios were found by O’Curry in one of the Sebright volumes (H. 2, 17).
Although the original <cite>Book of Lecain</cite> has thus passed from us, we possess a beautiful copy
(on vellum) written by Eugene O’Curry in the old Irish hand. It is worth noting that the
professional scribe still exists in Ireland, and writes a hand undistinguishable from that of
his predecessors many centuries ago.</p>

<p>In connection with the history of these two volumes, it is not inappropriate to
mention that of another important volume, the <cite>Book of Ballymote</cite>. This was formerly in
Trinity College Library, but was lent in 1720 to Dr. Raymond, and for a time disappeared.
In 1769 it turned up at Drogheda, and being purchased by Chevalier O’Gorman, was by
him presented to the Royal Irish Academy in 1785. We possess a paper copy of a portion
of it, including one folio which is now missing from the original volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is preserved the MS. already mentioned from which Jebb published Roger
Bacon’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opus Majus</i>, also the two MSS. from which Howard published the <cite>Chronicle of
Florence of Worcester</cite>; the original MS., as prepared for press, of Spottiswoode’s <cite>History of the
Church of Scotland</cite>; the original draft of Berkeley’s <cite>Principles of Human Knowledge</cite>; also
the originals of Sir Thomas Roe’s <cite>Correspondence</cite> (Ambassador to the Ottoman Porte,
1621-8, published London, 1740).</p>

<p>Of MSS. bearing on Irish history we have a fair collection. First may be mentioned
a volume of <cite>Letters of Queen Elisabeth on Public Affairs in Ireland, 1565 to 1570</cite>, each
letter having her sign-manual. There is also a volume of <cite>Correspondence of Sir Arthur
Chichester, Lord Deputy, with the English Government, 1612-1614</cite>; the thirty-two volumes
already mentioned of the <cite>Depositions relative to the Rising of 1641</cite>; thirteen volumes of
the <cite>Correspondence of Geo. Clarke, Secretary of War, 1690-1694</cite>; as many of <cite>Archbishop
King’s Correspondence, 1696-1729</cite>; <cite>Irish Treasury Accounts, 1714-1719</cite>; and twelve volumes
of Major Sirr’s papers, letters, etc., chiefly connected with the Rebellion in 1798. We have
also Dr. R. R. Madden’s large collection of papers relating to the United Irishmen.</p>

<p>There are several important volumes of Waldensian literature, which have been
catalogued and described by Todd in his <cite>Books of the Vaudois</cite>. With Wyclif literature
also we are well supplied, and we have one of the two known copies of the first complete
<cite>English Prose Psalter</cite>, recently published by Dr. Karl Bülbring for the Early English
Text Society. We have two MSS. of Piers Plowman, five of Rolle’s <cite>Pricke of Conscience</cite>,
and several hymns by Rolle (published by Todd in the <cite>British Magazine</cite>, vol. ix.). Dr.
Ingram, a few years ago, identified the earliest English translation of the <cite>De Imitatione</cite>,
disguised under the title the book occasionally bore&mdash;<cite>Musica Ecclesiastica</cite>.</p>

<p>Nor must I omit to mention the <cite>Life of St. Alban</cite> in Norman-French, probably in
the handwriting of Matthew Paris, the text of which has been published, with glossary, etc.,
by Professor Atkinson. The original MS. is adorned with pictures on nearly every page.</p>

<p>Illustrative of French history we possess statistical accounts of the French provinces
and cities of about the year 1698, filling thirty-two volumes; also a collection, in twenty-five
volumes, of <cite>Memoirs</cite> (some called “Secret”) <cite>of the Foreign and the Financial Affairs of France
in the Reign of Louis XV</cite>. These formed part of the Fagel Library. The same library
contains a large collection of maps, printed and MS., some of great rarity. Copies of two
or three of these have lately been made for the Colonial Office, as of value with respect to
a question of the boundary of British Guiana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Oriental manuscripts include a magnificent <cite>Koran</cite> from the Library of Tippoo,
presented by the East India Company; also a very fine copy of the <cite>Shâh Nâmeh</cite> from the
same library, likewise presented by the Company; some beautiful books from the Royal
Library at Shiraz, presented, with other Oriental MSS., by W. Digges Latouche; and many
fine Persian MSS., purchased from Sir W. Ouseley. An interesting and important Syriac
MS. has been lately identified by Prof. Gwynn. It contains, besides a treatise of Ephraim
Syrus, those parts of the New Testament which are not found in the <cite>Peshitto</cite> or Syriac
Vulgate; and Dr. Gwynn has demonstrated that it is the actual MS. referred to by De
Dieu and Walton as belonging to Ussher, and usually described erroneously as containing
the whole New Testament. This is the MS. from which De Dieu, and subsequently Walton,
printed the <cite>Pericopa de Adultera</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>To come to printed books. We have but one example of a block book&mdash;the <cite>Ars
Moriendi</cite>&mdash;and that imperfect. So far as it goes, it agrees with the British Museum copy
published by Mr. Rylands. We have a copy of the first German Bible [1466]; a single
leaf (on vellum) of the famous Mazarin Bible; and a copy of the Latin Bible printed at
Cologne by Nic. Goetz de Schletzstadt [1474].</p>

<p>The Quin collection includes the first edition of Petrarch: <cite>Sonetti e Trionfi</cite> (1470);
the first of the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite> (1472), and the first of Boccaccio’s <cite>Theseide</cite> (1475), very
rare; also a splendid copy, on vellum, of the second edition of <cite>Virgil</cite> (Venice: Vindelin
de Spira, 1470); also, <cite>Ystoria de re Karlo Imperatore</cite> (1473), exceedingly rare; the only
known vellum <cite>Elsevir</cite> (Heinsius: <cite>De Contemptu Mortis</cite>, 1621); <cite>Dita Mundi</cite>, by Fazio
degl’ Uberti; and the <cite>Adventures of Tewerdanck</cite>, on vellum (Nuremberg, 1517), a magnificent
specimen of printing. In the Fagel Library is an extremely fine Latin Plutarch, also on
vellum (Jenson, 1478). We have only one Caxton: <cite>Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers</cite>
(1477); unless we reckon a single leaf (an <em>Indulgence</em>), which Mr. Bradshaw considered to
be from Caxton’s press.</p>

<p>Amongst rare books may be enumerated&mdash;a Sarum <cite>Horae</cite> (Paris: Poitevin, about
1498, unique); a Sarum <cite>Breviary</cite> (Paris: Levet. 1494, unique), which seems to have been in
early times mistaken for a manuscript, and is consequently kept and catalogued among the
MSS. We have a copy of Werner Rolevinck’s <cite>Fasciculus Temporum</cite> in Dutch, printed at
Utrecht by Veldener, 1480&mdash;one of the earliest books with woodcuts in the text (coloured).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>A book of some interest exhibited in the glass case is Theseus Ambrosius: <cite>Introductio
in Chaldaicam Linguam</cite> (1539). It is of interest as being the first book in which Syriac types
were used, and next as containing a specimen of spirit-writing dating from the sixteenth
century. It seems that a question having arisen about some property of a deceased lady
which was supposed to be concealed, it was resolved to evoke a demon to answer the
question. A sheet of paper and a pen were placed on the table, and the proper incantation
being gone through, the pen rose up, without anyone seeing the hand that held it, and wrote
the characters of which Ambrosius gives a fac-simile, and which, unfortunately, no one has
been able to decipher. I am informed that in the copy of this book in the Bodleian Library
this particular leaf is pasted down, the “devil’s autograph,” no doubt, being deemed uncanny.</p>

<p>But to enumerate our rare books, or even our fifteenth-century books, would be
tedious, if it were possible. I must not, however, omit to refer to some fine specimens of
binding, most of which are in the Quin collection. We have six of Grolier’s books<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>&mdash;namely,
Erasmus: <cite>Pacis Querella</cite>; Palladius: <cite>Coryciana</cite>; Greek Psalter (Aldus); <cite>Il Nuovo Cortegiano</cite>;
<cite>Cynthio degli Fabritii</cite>; <cite>Della Origine delli Volgari Proverbi</cite>; and (perhaps the finest)
Guilelmus Tyrius: <cite>Belli Sacri Historia</cite> (folio). Of Maioli we have&mdash;Ori Apollinis <cite>de Sacris
Notis et Sculpturis</cite>, Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius; one by Monnier&mdash;<cite><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Spaccio de le'">Spaccio de la</ins>
Bestia Trionfante</cite>; and last, but not least, a copy of <cite>Quintus Calaber</cite>, which belonged to
Henry II. of France and Diane de Poitiers.</p>

<p>There are in the Library a few interesting objects other than books which deserve
notice. The satchel of the <cite>Book of Armagh</cite>, and the shrines of the <cite>Books of Dimma and
Mulling</cite>, have been already noticed. A very remarkable object is a Mosque Staff, presented
by Dr. Jolliffe Tufnell, who professionally attended Omar Pasha’s army in 1854. Such a
staff is used where there are no mosques, and being set up on a temporary structure, as a
heap of stones, it represents a mosque. On each of the four sides is carved a sentence from
the Koran. “I am in the house of the Lord.” “Evil and good are sent by God; be
content with your lot.” “Every day we offer our prayers to Thee.” “Forgive us all our
sins.” “With heart and soul we believe in Thee.”</p>

<p>An ancient Irish harp attracts the attention of visitors from the repute attaching to
it, of being the harp of Brian Boroimhe (pron. Boru, d. 1014). It is elegantly carved, and
in form much resembles the harp of Queen Mary, an engraving of which is exhibited beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it. It had thirty strings. The following is the tradition respecting this harp, as quoted
in the <cite>Ulster Journal of Archæology</cite>, vol. vii., p. 99, from a MS. by Ralph Ouseley, 1783.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
“It had been taken to Rome, and remained there until Innocent XI. sent it as a token of
good will to Charles II., who deposited it in the Tower. Soon afterwards, the Earl of
Clanricarde, seeing it, assured the King that he knew an Irish nobleman (meaning O’Brien,
Earl of Thomond) who would probably give a limb of his estate for this relic of his great
ancestor; on which his Majesty made him a present of it. Lord Clanricarde brought the
instrument to Ireland; but Lord Thomond, being abroad, never became possessed of it.
Some years after, a Lady Henley purchased it by barter, in exchange for twenty rams
and as many ewes of English breed, in order to give it to her son-in-law, Henry
M‘Mahon, Esq., of Clunagh, County Clare; from whom it passed through other hands to
an accomplished gentleman, the Right Hon. William Conyngham,” who presented it
to Trinity College. Conyngham seems to have been given the harp by Chevalier
O’Gorman, who gave a history of it (published in Vallancey’s <cite>Collectanea</cite>, vol. iv. 7)
differing from that just quoted. According to O’Gorman’s story, Brian’s son Donogh,
on being deposed, took the harp (with the crown and regalia) to Rome, and gave them
to the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> He adds the fiction that it was on the ground of possessing these
regalia that Pope Adrian claimed the right to dispose of the lordship of Ireland.
The story goes on to say that a later Pope gave the harp to Henry VIII., who presented
it to the first Earl of Clanricarde.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The celebrated antiquary, Dr. George Petrie, considered
that our harp dated from about <span class="fs70">A.D.</span> 1400, and was a portable instrument used for
ecclesiastical purposes. One strong objection to the earlier date he based on the fact
that it bore a silver badge with the arms of O’Neill, armorial bearings not having
been in use much earlier than the date he assigned. This badge disappeared for some
time, and fortunately came into the possession of a distinguished antiquary, Mr. Robert
Day, of Cork, affixed to a piece of armour found in some recent excavations in the
Phœnix Park. As soon as Mr. Day learned the history of the badge, he promptly
presented it to the Library. In its absence it was easy to observe that the carving was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
continuous, so that the badge must have been a later addition. Petrie’s first argument,
therefore, fell to the ground. It is true, however, that the figures of two wolf-dogs are
carved on the harp itself. His second objection was founded on the occurrence of the
letters IHC, which may be traced in a peculiar angular form near the top of the front
arm. But this also, in the opinion of good judges, is later than the rest of the carving.
The harp, therefore, may possibly be older than Petrie’s date. The sound-board is of oak
(as ascertained by microscopical examination), but very much decayed.</p>

<p>The same case which contains the harp contains also a few gold and silver ornaments
of elegant workmanship, and a large spear brooch, which, however, has none of the
characteristic Irish work, and is in fact very similar to a Scandinavian brooch figured in
M. Du Chaillu’s <cite>Viking Age</cite>, vol. ii., p. 329, but has more ornament. It is 13¾ in. long,
5½ wide across the circle, and weighs 18 oz. It is figured in Vallancey’s <cite>Collectanea</cite>, vol. i.,
where it is stated that it had recently (1786) been found near Cashel.</p>

<p>In the Librarian’s room is the largest of the gold ornaments yet found in Ireland. It
is in form like the small fibulae, but weighs 33 oz. 4 dwt. It is adorned with groups of
concentric circles and a series of acute angles, with no trace of the spirals so characteristic
of Celtic art in Christian times. From this it is inferred that it is of older date. This
ornament was found at Clones in 1820, and purchased by the College. The Charter horn
of the Kavanaghs, after being in the Library for a century, was a few years ago surrendered
to the family. A cast of it is exhibited.</p>

<p>A small bas-relief which hangs on one of the pillars calls for some notice. It
represents Demosthenes at the altar of Calaureia, where he took the fatal poison. The
whole posture, but especially the head, expresses the utmost dejection. The position of the
right hand also should be observed; instead of clasping the knee, it hangs idly on one side.
There is an engraving of this work in Winckelmann’s <cite>History of Art</cite>, but the engraver, by
raising the chin, has quite lost the aspect of dejection, and rather gives the impression that
the orator is meditating a speech. It is also engraved in Allen’s <cite>Demosthenes</cite> and
in Stock’s <cite>Demosthenes</cite>. This relief belonged to Dr. Richard Mead, and is said to have
been found in the ruins of Hadrian’s Villa. After Mead’s sale in 1755, where it was
purchased by a London dealer, it disappeared from view until about 1885, when I
had the good fortune to identify it in the centre ornament of a mantelpiece in the room
which formerly contained the Museum (now the Front Hall), and which was built in
1759. Certain errors in the arrangement of the drapery have suggested doubts as to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
genuineness.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> On the other hand, in its favour is the fact that the features resemble those
of the bust found in Herculaneum in 1753; but it was known in 1737, before the discovery
of that bust, and at a time when a wholly different type of face was accepted as that of
Demosthenes. Possibly even ancient artists may have erred sometimes.</p>

<p>Another objection is the misspelling of the name&mdash;viz., ΔΗΜΩΣΘΕΝΗΣ. But would not
a modern sculptor, who would presumably be too ignorant of Greek to substitute Ω for Ο,
be less likely to commit this error than a Roman sculptor of Hadrian’s time, who would
probably know a little Greek?</p>

<p>Just inside the entrance to the building are two Medallion Busts which were brought
from Smyrna in 1707. They are mentioned by Gudius and Boeckh.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> They were made
the subject of a learned dissertation by Dr. Kennedy Bailie (<cite>Transactions, Royal Irish
Academy</cite>, vol. xxii.). He concludes that the larger medallion represents Plautilla, wife of
Caracella, deified under the title ΝΕΑ ἩΡΑ, but afterwards deposed and banished.</p>

<p>Our collection of Coins is not very large. Of Roman coins, silver and copper, we
have a fairly good collection&mdash;about 1,300 silver and a couple of thousand copper. A
selection of these is exhibited. The collection ought to be better, but unfortunately, about
a hundred years ago (viz., in 1788), the room where the coins were then kept (now the
Fagel) was burglariously entered, and the most valuable coins and medals stolen. Recently,
the late Rev. Dr. R. F. Littledale bequeathed a small collection of English coins and
medals.</p>

<p>An old Minute Book of the Library, chiefly in the handwriting of Dr. Barrett,
contains occasional items of interest. Here we read of a ship with books for the Library
cast away, the books, however, being recovered, but damaged, some irrecoverably. Again,
we find some books which had been stolen restored through the Roman Catholic priest to
whom the thief had made confession. On another occasion a parcel of stolen books is thrown
into the Provost’s courtyard. An amusing entry occurs, in which Dr. Barrett states his
intention to ask permission to lock up a certain <cite>Narrative of a Residence in Ireland</cite>, by
Mrs. Anne. Plumptre (1815), stating that it is too silly and too ill-mannered for a public
library. “Hospitably entertained by the good-natured, blundering Irish, and introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
(perhaps for the first time in her life) into good company, she takes care to let [the] world
know it by publishing all the little tea-table talk they had indulged in to amuse her, and
many of whom are probably now blushing at seeing it embodied in a pompous quarto,
illustrated with engravings. Travel in savage countries, Mrs. Anne, and publish their
conversations if you can, but spare the feelings of those who are accustomed to the rules
and decencies of civilised life.”</p>

<p>An account of the Library would be incomplete if the Catalogue were left unnoticed.
The first printed Catalogue was issued about 1710 in one thin volume, folio. We have now
a printed Catalogue in nine folio volumes, which includes all the printed books in the
Library at the end of the year 1872. The first volume of this Catalogue (A and B) was
prepared under the direction of Dr. Todd, and issued in 1864. The work was then
suspended, and not resumed until 1872, when a special editor, Mr. H. Dix. Hutton, was
appointed, the time of the Library staff being fully employed otherwise. The Catalogue was
completed Jan. 1, 1887, the expense of printing and paper alone having been £4,500. Since
that time Mr. Hutton has been engaged in preparing a Supplementary Catalogue, to contain
the subsequent accessions. When this has been completed up to the present time, it is
intended to make it a Desk Catalogue, in which all new accessions will be inserted on
printed slips. The Catalogue is primarily an author’s catalogue&mdash;that is to say, books are
arranged under the names of their authors, where known. But by the liberal use of cross
references and secondary entries, some of the advantages of a subject catalogue are
obtained. In the Desk Catalogue now in preparation, the method adopted by the editor,
Mr. Hutton, is as follows:&mdash;One copy of the printed slip is taken, and in the upper left-hand
corner the proper subject heading is type-written by him, and this slip is then inserted
in alphabetical order, according to this heading. This saves the expense of printing a fresh
title for the secondary entry.</p>

<p>Of our MSS. the earliest existing catalogue is that of 1688, which was compiled
with great care. This is also the only catalogue at present accessible to readers at a
distance, having been printed in Bernard’s <cite>Catalogus Manuscriptorum Angliæ et Hiberniæ</cite>.
In the Library itself the catalogue most commonly used is one drawn up by Dr. John
Lyon about 1745, which, however, only extends to Classis G. A more complete catalogue,
extending to Classis M, was prepared by Dr. Henry J. Monck Mason, about the year 1814,
for the Irish Commissioners of Public Records, with a view to publication. The terms
proposed by Dr. Monck Mason and his specimen of the work were approved, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
rough copy (in five volumes) was finished he was required to hand it over to the Board.
Then the question of remuneration was raised, and it was discovered that no minute had
been entered of the original engagement; and as some of the members of the Board had
been changed, the engagement, in the absence of a written vote, was not held to be
sufficient to outweigh considerations of public economy.</p>

<p>Dr. Monck Mason devoted much conscientious labour and intelligence to the work.
He was assisted in the department of Irish MSS. by Edward O’Reilly; in that of Oriental
MSS. by Edward Hincks, then sub-librarian;
and in the Icelandic MSS. by George Cash.
It is much to be lamented that the work
was not published as designed. The MSS.
in the Irish language have been catalogued
by Dr. O’Donovan in one thick folio
volume. There exists also a card catalogue,
consisting of about 20,000 cards, prepared
under the direction of Dr. Benjamin Dickson,
assistant librarian. He employed, at his
own expense, a person acquainted with the
Irish vernacular, but otherwise not as well
qualified as might be wished (the inevitable
result of want of means to pay a qualified
scholar).</p>

<p>It is in contemplation to print a
summary catalogue much briefer than Dr.
Monck Mason’s, but containing sufficient
information about each volume to indicate
to students at a distance what they may expect to look for in it. A catalogue of this
kind need not occupy more than one volume, and might be sold at such a price as
would make it generally accessible.</p>

<p>It may interest librarians to learn how the accommodation has been from time to time
enlarged. Up to the end of the eighteenth century, the room in the east wing, now occupied
by the Fagel Library, was set apart as the MSS. Room. In the stalls in the Long Room,
where the short bookcases are at present, there were seats like settles, the ends of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
still remain. From the high cases projected sloping desks, below which there were no books.
The engraving in Malton’s <cite>Views of Dublin</cite> represents this
state of things. These seats and desks were removed in
1817. The Reading Room was the upper room in the west
wing, now the Clerks’ Room. The whole of the ground
floor, except in the wings, was an open ambulatory, divided length-wise
by a central wall, the south side being used by the Fellows.
The rooms on the ground floor in both wings were Lecture
Rooms&mdash;that at the west for Law, that at the east end for
Divinity. The Law Lecture Room also contained the Lending
Library. There were no bookcases in the gallery.</p>

<p>In 1802 the Fagel Library was placed in the East Room,
and the MSS. were removed to the
room above it. The next step was
the erection of the short bookcases in
the stalls. In 1844 Dr. Todd introduced
the ingenious device of low
bookcases in the windows of the
gallery, revolving on hinges, and
with shelves on both sides. In the
central part of the building, where the
walls are thicker, there were two of
these&mdash;one outside the other&mdash;so that, with the fixed
shelves at the back, there were five shelves in
depth and four in height. In the shallower windows
these were but three in depth. In 1860 it had become
necessary to reconstruct the roof, and then bookcases
were placed on the gallery over those below, and reaching
to the roof. Most of the revolving cases had then to
be removed.</p>

<p>Meantime, in 1848, the room on the ground floor in the east wing had been
made a Reading Room, and heated by hot-water pipes. A spiral staircase connected
it with the room above. When it became necessary to have a means of communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with the gallery at this end, it was proposed either to continue this staircase, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
construct a similar one at the other end of the room. The objection to this scheme
was a remarkable one: it would give too great vent for the heated air, and so cause
draughts; in other words, it would help to ventilate the Reading Room&mdash;the very thing
that was wanted!</p>

<p>When the new Lecture Rooms and Museum were built, the MSS. were removed to
their present place on the ground floor near the entrance, and some twenty-five years after
that, bookcases were constructed in the upper east room. A few years ago these were in
their turn nearly filled, and it became necessary to enclose the ground floor of the Library.
This work was completed this year (1892). The western third of this space constitutes the
new Reading Room.</p>

<p>Only graduates (of Dublin, Oxford, or Cambridge) have the right of admission to the
Library; but the privilege has always been freely granted to persons properly introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
whether graduates of a university or not, so that it is, in fact, a public library. In 1856 it
was resolved by the Board and Visitors to grant admission to students who have entered
on their third year, that being the usual period for commencing professional studies; but
admission is always granted at an earlier period to a student whose studies are such as to
make it desirable.</p>

LIBRARY STAIRCASE AND ENTRANCE TO READING ROOM.</div>
</div>

<p>Previously to 1843, readers were allowed to take books from the shelves themselves,
but in that year this privilege was limited to the Fellows and Professors, except in the
Reading Room, where books of reference and other books in frequent demand are accessible
to all readers. This change caused a considerable diminution in the number of readers. A
similar resolution had been passed in 1817, but rescinded a few months after, it being thought
to be contrary to the Statutes, which forbade readers to replace a book anywhere except in
its place on the shelves. The Provost (Elrington) protested against the rescission, alleging,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</i>, that free access to the shelves led to the reading of indecent books, and he had
even known books of magic to be read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The hours during which the Library was open were formerly eight to ten, and
eleven to one. We read once or twice of permission being given to readers to remain
locked in between ten and eleven. The hour of closing was afterwards postponed to two
o’clock. At present, the Reading Room is open from ten to six; the Library itself is closed
at three in winter, and four in summer.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE EARLY BUILDINGS.</span></h2>

<p class="p1" />
<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_195b.jpg" width="90" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">When Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, had induced Queen Elizabeth to
grant a Charter of Incorporation to a University to be established in Dublin,
he addressed himself to the Mayor and Corporation of the City with a view to
obtaining a suitable site. And, happily for the success of the scheme which he
and the more academic Luke Challoner so successfully carried out, and for the
future welfare of the new Institution, a site the most suitable and the most admirable that
could have been found in Ireland was at that moment at the disposal of the Corporation of
Dublin&mdash;the old Augustinian Monastery of All Hallows, lying to the eastward, and just outside
the City. As far as we can gather from the recitals in the lease of the monastic buildings
and site made by the Mayor and Sheriffs in the year 1591 to John Spensfield, the precincts,
besides a church, consisted of “a steeple, a building with a vault under it, the spytor, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
called the hall, with appurtenances all along to the north cheek of the Bawn Gate.” We find
that there were also within the precincts of the Monastery the sub-prior’s orchard and the common
orchard, and a field called the Ashe Park, wherein the prior and the monks had their haggard
and cistern, with the western storehouse by the Great Bawn, together with a vestry cloister, a
little garden within the precincts, and a tower over the gate adjoining Hoggen Green. The
buildings, without the lands, appear to have been let to John Pepard, merchant, for sixty-one
years, at ten shillings a-year, with a clause restraining him from taking stones, or slates, or
timber out of the precincts; the materials thereon were to be used only for building on the
site. Another lease was made to Edward Pepard, in 1584, of a small orchard in All Hallows
for thirty-one years, at twenty-four shillings a-year; and in 1583 Edward Pepard had sub-let,
for twenty-one years, to Peter van Hey and Thomas Seele, a garden with a vault at the
north side of All Hallows, at a yearly rent of forty shillings, with a covenant that they
should keep up the garden wall and the vaults. It would thus appear that at this time
the Pepards had acquired the site of the buildings and a small orchard, possibly that
formerly occupied by the sub-prior, as tenants on a terminable lease. During the fifty years
which elapsed from the suppression of the Monastery, the buildings must have suffered very
considerable dilapidation. Most likely they had not been originally erected in a very
substantial and durable manner; and as little care seems to have been taken as to the
maintenance of the church, the hall, and the monastic dwellings, they must have been for
the most part in a ruinous condition. The total value of the site and precincts is stated
in a letter from Queen Elizabeth to have been £20 a-year. At the close of the Queen’s reign
the City of Dublin did not extend towards the east beyond St. George’s Lane, now called
South Great George’s Street. An open space of ground stretched from thence to All Hallows,
with paths diverging to different parts of a small stream, beyond which lay the site of the
old Monastery. The whole of the precincts at that time covered about twenty-eight acres,
of which twelve were in meadow, nine in pasture, and seven in orchard. On the north,
towards the river, there was a boggy strip of ground covered by the water at high tide,
and bounded on the south by the path leading to St. Patrick’s Well, near the present
entrance to Kildare Street, and bounded on the east by lands formerly belonging to the
Abbey of the Blessed Virgin, but then in the tenure of John Dougan, on the site of the
modern Westland Row.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>And such was the influence of the Archbishop, supported by his Archdeacon, Henry
Ussher, and by Luke Chaloner, of Trinity College, Cambridge, and two Scotch schoolmasters,
James Hamilton and James Fullerton, who were at the time in Dublin, that the
Corporation convened the citizens to a general assembly at the Tholsel, where they, after
due deliberation upon the proposal to grant the site of the monastery for the intended
College, immediately proceeded to make the grant. A Charter of Incorporation had in
the meantime been obtained from the Queen, on the petition of Henry Ussher. The
letter of Elizabeth to Sir William Fitzwilliam, Lord Deputy, and to the Irish Council,
announcing her consent to this arrangement, is dated December 21st, 1591; and, on the 3rd
of the following March, Letters Patent passed the Great Seal.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The first stone of the new
building was laid on March 13th, 1592. Subscriptions from the gentry in every part of
Ireland were received for the building, and on January 9th, 1594, the new College was
completed. No remains of this structure exist at the present day; indeed, no buildings
prior to the reign of William III. are now to be found in Trinity College. The Elizabethan
edifice consisted of a small square court, which was always familiarly called The
Quadrangle, and which was removed early in the latter half of the eighteenth century. Some
parts of the old monastery were no doubt utilised in the new building. As the visitor
approached from Hoggen Green he crossed an outer enclosed court, which formed an
entrance to the College; he then entered through the great gate, and found himself in a
small square, probably on the site of the southern portion of the great main square of the
College, then surrounded by buildings constructed of thin red Dutch brick, with probably a
good deal of wooden framework inserted. On the north side lay the old steeple of the
monastery, having the porter’s lodge on the ground floor, and a chamber over it; and on the
second loft was hung the College bell. Towards the east of the steeple lay the Chapel;
on the same side of the quadrangle was the Hall, paved with tiles, with a gallery, and a
lantern in the roof. The hall was separated from the kitchen by a wooden partition, and
in the same range with them was placed the Library. This room was over the scholars’
chambers, and had a gallery, and the lower part of it was fitted with ten pews for readers.
The Regent House seems to have been between the Chapel and the Hall, and a gallery in
the Regent House looked into the Chapel. This range of buildings extended to the east
side of the court, beyond the site of the present Campanile. On the north of this range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
lay the kitchen, buttery chamber, and the storehouse. The east and west sides of the
quadrangle contained students’ chambers, and on the south side were placed houses for the
Fellows. The three sides composed in all seven buildings for residence&mdash;three on the south
side, and two on each of the east and west sides. The upper story was lightened by
dormer windows, with leaden lattices, and in the centre of the quadrangle stood the
celebrated College pump.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE ELIZABETHAN COLLEGE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">For this interesting section as to the Elizabethan College, the writer is indebted to the
Rev. J. W. Stubbs, D.D., S.F.T.C.D.:&mdash;</p>

<p>For a long period it was impossible to form an accurate idea of the size and
arrangements of the buildings of the original College. The very foundations have long
since been obliterated. Speed’s map gives a rough idea of its site and general shape; and
Rocque’s map, which was constructed in 1751, before the structure was removed, shows
its position with regard to the present Library and some of the portions of the College
which remain. Dunton’s <cite>Life and Errors</cite> gives a description of the buildings as they stood
one hundred years after their erection, yet his details are in some respects misleading.</p>

<p>In the present year, a paper in the handwriting of Sir William Temple, Provost in
1523, has been found, giving the distribution of the chambers in the College among the
Fellows and students in that year, and which, with the aid of the preceding authorities
and letters of the period, enables us to form a fairly accurate conception of the buildings as
they existed in the time of James the First.</p>

<p>The College was a quadrangle, the eastern and western sides being longer than those
on the north and south. The approach was through a tower which lay on the north side,
and which was the “steeple” of the old Monastery, having the porter’s lodge on the ground
floor, and a chamber over it. In the second story was placed the College bell. The
remainder of the north side was occupied by the Chapel and the Hall; the Chapel lay towards
the east, and the Hall towards the west, of the entrance. There appears to have been an
attic over one of these buildings, which contained four “studies” for undergraduates. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Regent House seems to have been located between the Chapel and the Hall, for candidates
for degrees passed through the Hall into the Regent House, and a gallery in the Regent
House looked into the Chapel. The Hall was paved with tiles, had a lantern in the roof,
and had a gallery, probably communicating with the room over the porter’s lodge. On
the south side of the quadrangle, which lay between the present Library and the
centre of the present Examination Hall, there were four houses; the ground floors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
these houses were occupied by students’ rooms, there being ten “studies” occupied
by fourteen students. The house on the east of the south side had no other chambers
occupied, and the first and second stories probably contained the library, which we may
learn from the College accounts of the period had a gallery and a lower story which was
fitted up with ten “pews” for readers. The next house had two students resident on the
ground floor, and two Fellows on the first floor. The third house had three “studies” on
the ground floor, but the first and second stories were not occupied by students or by Fellows.
Possibly it was in this house that Ussher’s books were afterwards placed. The fourth house
had two “studies” on the ground floor, and a Fellow and a student occupied the first floor.</p>

<p>On the east side of the quadrangle there were six houses, each having “studies” for
three students on the ground floor. In the first of these houses the remaining floors were
unoccupied. In the second, three students occupied the attic. Chambers were there assigned
also to one Fellow, one Master of Arts, and to the Professor of Divinity. In the third
house there were three “studies” on the ground floor, but the remaining floors were not
assigned for chambers. In the fourth house there were three “studies” on the ground floor&mdash;two
Fellows and two Masters of Arts occupied the first floor, and a Master of Arts the
attic. The fifth house had three “studies” on the ground floor&mdash;three Fellows and one
student had chambers on the first floor, and five students resided in the attic story. The
sixth house had three “studies” on the ground floor, and three graduates resided over
them.</p>

<p>On the west side there were three houses, with three “studies” on the ground floor
of each. The first house had no occupied chambers over the ground floor. In the second
house one Fellow and two Masters of Arts had chambers on the first floor; one Master of
Arts and two students resided in the attic. The first floor of the third house on this side
was occupied by two Fellows and by one Master of Arts, and the attic by two students,
apparently brothers. The remainder of the west side was possibly occupied by the
Provost’s chambers.</p>

<p>There was no approach to the interior of the College from Hoggen Green, nor did
the ground on the west side of the College at that time belong to it. We find in 1639 a letter
from Provost Bedell to Ussher giving an account of a riot among the students, which arose
from an attempt of one Arthur to make an enclosure on that side of the College on land
which he had leased from the City of Dublin. A petition was forwarded from the College
to the Council complaining of Arthur’s proceeding to erect a building on that side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
College, by which a passage would be taken away where there was in former times a
gate or way leading into the site upon which the College was built, which, although at
that time closed, was intended to be opened again by the College. It ended in the College
acquiring Arthur’s interest in the plot, and so preserving a right of way.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">COLLEGE GREEN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The ground at present known as College Green was once the site of a considerable
village outside the walls of the City of Dublin, known as Hog or Hogges.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> A convent for
nuns of the rule of St. Augustine was founded on les Hogges in 1146 by Dermot
MacMurchard, King of Leinster, and the open space obtained the name of Hoggen Green.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
How the nunnery of St. Mary atte Hogge was dissolved, and the buildings granted to the
citizens of Dublin in 1534; how it was proposed to turn the buildings into a jail or
bridewell; how, in consequence of some dispute with the builder, the property was handed
over to the University, and became a second College or High School under the name of
Trinity Hall; and how at length, in 1667, thanks to the efforts of Dr. Stearne, the
President, Trinity Hall was converted into the College of Physicians of Ireland, is all very
interesting, but it is quite outside the scope of the present chapter. The modern Trinity
Street marks the site of Trinity Hall, which was only demolished about the year 1700.
Hogges Gate, the eastern gate of the City of Dublin opening upon Hoggen Green, facing
the College, and standing somewhere near the site of the modern Forster Place, was removed
in 1663 as being not only useless, but ruinous. The equestrian statue of King William
III., that is now so prominent a feature of College Green, was erected by the Corporation of
Dublin, and unveiled with great pomp on the 1st of July, 1801. The figure of Henry
Grattan was executed by J. H. Foley, R.A., an Irish artist, and placed in its present
position in January, 1876. The fine bronze statues of Edmund Burke and Oliver
Goldsmith, truly distinguished students of Trinity College, which are also the work of
Foley, stand within the College railings on either side of the Grand Entrance. That of
Goldsmith was placed in its present position in January, 1864; and that of Burke in April,
1868. They are both admirable. The statue of Goldsmith especially is one of the finest,
if not the finest work of the sculptor.</p>

the buildings of the new College seemed to have sufficed for the accommodation of the
students; but in October, 1751, a petition of the Provost, Fellows, and Scholars of the
College of Dublin to the Irish Parliament set forth “That the said College does not contain
chambers sufficient for lodging the number of young gentlemen who, for several years past,
have been sent thither for education, and that many of the buildings of the said College
are, from length of time, become ruinous, and are not capable of being restored; that by
the Statutes of the College no provision is made for new buildings, or for any other than
the annual repairs of the buildings originally provided, notwithstanding which the petitioners
have expended several large sums, which by great care they have saved out of the ordinary
expenses of the College, on necessary public buildings, and to increase the number of
chambers for the reception of students.” Five thousand pounds were granted by Parliament
in response to this petition, and the money was expended on the necessary buildings. Two
years afterwards (1753) we find a further sum of ten thousand pounds placed at the disposal
of the College authorities by the Irish Government. The money was spent, and well spent,
on building. And a further petition, on the 1st of November, 1755, was presented to
George II., and a further grant of twenty thousand pounds made to the College to enable them
to rebuild the West Front. In 1757, the College authorities appear once more as petitioners
to Parliament, stating that they have, with all possible expedition and care, finished the
said north side for which former grants had been made, and are now rebuilding the front,
for which further funds were needed; and a further and final sum of ten thousand pounds
was then placed at their disposal by His Majesty’s Government. And the College accounts
show that between 1752 and 1763 a gross sum of £48,820 had been expended on the work
of construction.</p>

<p>Of the buildings that were erected in Trinity College at the end of the sixteenth
century, we have neither roof nor foundation now remaining. Of the still older buildings
that stood on Hoggen Green in 1583, we have neither trace nor exact record, beyond
that they contained a church, a steeple, a building with a vault under it, and the spytor
already alluded to.</p>

TRINITY COLLEGE&mdash;WEST FRONT.</div>
</div>

<p>In a curious old print, however, of the beginning of the eighteenth century, some
buildings are figured abutting upon the Library, and running westwards in the direction of
the present Theatre, which were probably a portion of the old buildings erected in 1594.
The lines of the Cistercian Monastery are supposed by Mr. Drew, the accomplished
architect of the University, to have been a square, of which the south side occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
site now partially covered by the Theatre, and extending to the north about half way across
the present main quadrangle of Parliament Square. That a sixteenth-century College should
retain no stone of sixteenth-century masonry is certainly regrettable. But what is far more
remarkable is, that of the presumably more appropriate and substantial structures which
were in existence when William of Orange landed at Torbay, not a vestige is standing
at the present time. And of the noble buildings which now compose the College, by far
the greater part is no older than the reign of King George III.</p>

<p>The University has ever been, as it is, one of the few entirely satisfactory and
successful institutions planted by England in the sister isle, and it has ever promoted
sound learning and religious education; but architecture, or even good building, was for the
first century and a-half of its existence most certainly not its strong point. Nor has Irish
artistic feeling at any time been commonly expressed in Architecture. Ireland has given to
the Empire soldiers and statesmen, poets and orators, philosophers and divines, men of
science and men of action, governors, ministers, judges, in numbers and in eminence quite
out of proportion to her population and her advantages. But of architects of the first or
even of the second class, no Irishman has inscribed his name on the roll of honour as a
designer of great works at home or abroad. The domestic architecture and the national
ecclesiastical style of building is poor, mean, and uninteresting; and although Dublin to-day
is adorned with many handsome structures, none of them can be said to have any peculiarly
national characteristics, and of the most important now existing, none are the work of
native architects. Gandon, who built the Custom House and part of the Houses of
Parliament, was a Frenchman; Cooly, who designed the Exchange and the Four Courts,
was an Englishman;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Cassels, who did some of the best eighteenth-century work in Trinity
College, was a German; Sir William Chambers, who designed the Theatre and the Chapel
in Parliament Square, and who was perhaps the greatest British architect of the eighteenth
century, was a Scotchman.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Nor does the architect, native or foreign, appear to have been
held in honour at the University a hundred and fifty years ago. The very name of the
designer of the admirable west front of the College is forgotten, unrecorded even in the
College accounts; and the architect of the Provost’s House, who bore the very Saxon name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of Smith, is stated to have received a fee of £22 15s. for his services. The art could
scarcely flourish on such very slender patronage! But whoever the designers may have
been, and however remunerated, the College builders of the seventeenth century must have
been grossly incompetent. For though work of various kinds seems to have been in
constant progress from 1592 to the beginning of the eighteenth century, we find in 1751
that many of the buildings had, from length of time, become ruinous, and were not even
capable of being restored. Nor does any great improvement appear even in the eighteenth
century. The new Dining Hall, put up in 1740, had to be taken down to prevent its tumbling
about the students’ ears in 1750; and the Bell Tower, completed only in 1746, at a cost of
nearly £4,000, was “removed” in 1791, as already, after a life of only five-and-forty years,
it was “entirely unsafe.” But in the last half-century very different work has been done.
The noble Campanile, erected in 1853, is at once admirable in design and most solid in
construction, and, above all, most appropriately placed. The New Square, which covers a
part of what was once suggestively termed the Wilderness, is irreproachable, if not very
interesting in design and workmanship; and the Venetian Palace that forms its southern
side affords some of that colour and variety which is so sadly wanting in other parts of
the College, and is in itself a structure that would command admiration in any town or
country. And the new buildings of the Medical School, if plain and unpretentious, are
simple and appropriate and dignified in design, and their cut granite looks well fitted to
last for a thousand years.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE PROVOST’S HOUSE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Provost’s House is commonly said to be a copy of a design by Lord Burlington
for General Wade’s house in Piccadilly. General, or rather Field-Marshal Wade was a
notable person in his day. He put down the Glasgow Riots in 1727, and did much towards
the pacification of Scotland by the construction of the celebrated military roads in the
Highlands. He also commanded the English army in Lancashire and Yorkshire at the
time of the Pretender’s invasion of England in 1745. His house, which was built in 1723,
was not in Piccadilly, nor in any street leading out of it, but in Cork Street, extending back
as far as Old Burlington Street; and on Marshal Wade’s death in 1748 it was sold by
auction, according to Horace Walpole,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> to Lord Chesterfield, and seems afterwards to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
been the town house of the Marquess Cornwallis, and known as Cornwallis House.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> And in
1826 it was added to, and included with Sir Thomas Neaves’ house, next door, as the
Burlington Hotel, now Nos. 19, and 20, Cork Street.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The façade and ground plan of
Lord Burlington’s design is given by Campbell, Moore, and Gandon in their <cite>Vitruvius
Britannicus</cite>, vol. iii., plate 10; and the house is there said to be in Great Burlington Street
(now Old Burlington Street), a much older street than Cork Street. Marshal Wade’s house
has been scarcely altered since it was built in the eighteenth century; his arms are still

is shown by the College accounts for 1759.</p>

<p>The mansion stands on the east side of Grafton Street, about twenty yards from the
western side of the Parliament Square. The main entrance is from Grafton Street, through
a spacious courtyard, enclosed by a granite wall 310 feet in length, and is entered by a
handsome gateway. There is a private corridor, or covered way, which connects the house
directly with Parliament Square within the walls of the College. The façade is of granite,
finely ashlared. The ground story is of icicled and rusticated work, over which a range of
Doric pilasters, with their architrave, frieze, and cornice supporting a high pitched roof with
no eave. In the principal story are five windows, with balusters beneath, arranged two on
either side of a large Venetian window, with columns and ornaments of the Tuscan order.
The interior of the house is original and interesting; the hall and ante-hall are spacious
and dignified; the circular staircase, which is lighted by a lofty domed skylight, leads up
to a fine suite of apartments. On the ground floor, with an entrance from the hall, and
approached through an ante-room, is the large dining-room, which is now used as the
Provost’s Library and as the Board-room, where the Provost and Senior Fellows assemble
in council to deliberate upon the administration and government of the College. In this
room and in the ante-room is a collection of portraits of all the Provosts, from the time of
Adam Loftus to Dr. MacDonnell, and of many of the distinguished Fellows and Professors
of the College, and other important personages connected with the University. On the
staircase is a portrait of George I., by Sir Godfrey Kneller; another of George III., by
Allan Ramsay; and one of Hugh Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh, painted by Bindon for
the Foundling Hospital. All these are full-length portraits. The most interesting picture
in the house is, perhaps, a half-length portrait of Queen Elizabeth, by Zucchero, hanging
in the large drawing-room; where there is also a full-length portrait by Gainsborough&mdash;the
artistic gem of the collection&mdash;of John Russell, Duke of Bedford, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
1757, and Chancellor of the University of Dublin. There is also in the drawing-room a
half-length portrait of Archbishop Ussher, one of the earliest Fellows of the College
(Professor of Divinity, 1607; Vice-Chancellor of the University, 1614; and Archbishop of
Armagh, 1624), and buried, like Primate Boulter, in Westminster Abbey. In the Provost’s
apartments on the ground floor is a picture of Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin and
Lord Chancellor of Ireland, 1567, and first Provost of Trinity College, 1592, by an unknown
artist, as well as a copy of the same by Cregan; and a head of Archbishop Ussher. There
are two portraits said to be of Samuel Winter, the Puritan Provost appointed by Cromwell
in 1562, but possibly portraits of Luke Challoner, one of the more distinguished founders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the University. There are also portraits of Sir William Temple, Provost of Trinity
College, 1609; John Stearne, M.D., Fellow of Trinity College, 1660; Michael Ward, D.D.,
Provost, 1674, Vice-Chancellor of the University, 1678; Anthony Dopping, D.D., Fellow of
Trinity College, 1662; Narcissus Marsh, Provost of Trinity College, 1678; St. George Ashe,
D.D., Provost, 1692; Peter Browne, D.D., Provost, 1699; H.R.H. George, Prince of Wales,
Chancellor of the University of Dublin, 1715; Sir Hans Sloane, Bart., M.D. of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
University of Dublin, who died in 1752; Sir Philip Tisdall, Privy Councillor and M.P. for
the University, 1739; William Clements, M.D., Fellow of Trinity College, 1733, M.P. 1761;
Francis Andrews, LL.D., Provost, 1758, by Antonio Maroni; Bryan Robinson, M.D., Regius
Professor of Physic in the University, 1745, by Wilson; John Hely Hutchinson, LL.D.,
Provost, 1774, and Secretary of State for Ireland, by Peacock; Richard Murray, D.D.

Dalzac, D.D., Fellow of Trinity College, 1760; John Forsayeth, D.D., Fellow of Trinity
College, 1762; John Kearney, D.D., Provost, 1799, by Cumming; Matthew Young, D.D.,
Fellow of Trinity College, 1775; George Hall, D.D., Provost, 1806, by Cumming; Arthur
Browne, LL.D., Fellow of Trinity College, 1777, by Hamilton; Thomas Elrington, D.D.,
Provost, 1811, by Foster; Bartholomew Lloyd, D.D., Provost, 1831, by Campanile; Samuel
Kyle, D.D., Provost, 1820; Franc Sadleir, D.D., Provost, 1837; Richard MacDonnell, D.D.,

DRAWING ROOM, PROVOST’S HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>The various offices attached to the house are conveniently disposed in the wings, the
height of the ground story. The rooms at the back of the mansion look out upon a large
lawn and pleasure-ground, beyond which are the Fellows’ Garden and the College Park.
From the windows of the house to the Cricket Pavilion at the further end of the Park is
nearly a quarter of a mile of green sward, a noble expanse in the heart of a great city.
The only intervening structure is a small building of Portland stone, of pseudo Greek or
classical design&mdash;the Magnetical Observatory. This little temple of modern science was
built in the year 1837 at the instigation of the celebrated mathematician, Dr. Humphrey
Lloyd, afterwards (1867) Provost of Trinity College; and at the time of its completion in
1838 it was the only observatory specifically devoted to magnetic research&mdash;with the
exception of that at Greenwich, under the direction of the Astronomer-Royal&mdash;in the United
Kingdom. And it was here that Dr. Lloyd conducted those numerous and most interesting
experiments, of which the results were communicated to many successive meetings of the
British Association. The building itself, in the Doric order of architecture, was erected
under the superintendence and from the design of Mr. Frederic Darley, of Dublin. The
front elevation is not ungraceful, being partly copied from an Athenian model. But the
architectural beauty of the rest of the building has been sacrificed to the scientific necessities
of the interior, and the result is very far from satisfactory as a work of art. It stands in
latitude 53° 21′ N. and longitude 16° 6′ W. It is forty feet in length by thirty feet in width,
constructed of Portland stone, the interior being of the calpe, or argillaceous limestone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the valley of Dublin. Several specimens of each of these stones were submitted to severe
tests, and found to be entirely devoid of any magnetic influence. To preserve a uniform
temperature, and also as a protection from damp, the walls are studded internally. The nails
employed in the wood-work are all of copper, and all locks and metal work of every kind
throughout the building of brass or gun metal. No iron, of course, was used in any part
of the work. The interior is divided into one principal room and two smaller rooms,
lighted by a dome at the top, and by one window at either end of the building.</p>

<p>A complete account of this Observatory within and without, and of the numerous and
most interesting instruments which it contains, will be found in <cite>An Account of the Magnetical
Observatory of Dublin, and of the Instruments and Methods of Observation employed there</cite>, by
the Rev. Humphrey Lloyd, D.D., University Press, 1842.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">WEST FRONT.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The principal or west front of Trinity College, looking on to Grafton Street, College
Green, and the old Houses of Parliament, now occupied by the Bank of Ireland, is a
Palladian façade three hundred feet in length and sixty-five feet in height, occupying the
whole of the eastern side of the large paved space which is still called College Green. The
centre or principal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de logis</i> is one hundred feet in length. The entablature is
supported by four detached columns with Corinthian capitals; and a bold but simple
pediment surmounts the whole. At either corner is a square pilaster with a Corinthian
capital. The building is continued on either side of this centre to a distance of seventy feet
of plain and unadorned construction; the ground story of rustic ashlar, the remainder of
fine cut granite. The north and south extremities of this great front are formed by two
square pavilions rising above the height of the wings, and projecting about ten feet from
the curtain line. The pavilions are pierced by four handsome Palladian windows, in the
north and west and in the south and west fronts respectively; and the construction is
ornamented at the projecting angles by coupled pilasters of the Corinthian order, supporting
an attic story, surmounted by a very satisfactory balustrade. In the entire façade are fifty-one
windows regularly disposed, giving light to four stories of rooms. According to the original
plan the centre of the building was to have been crowned by a dome, and the abandonment
of what might have given additional nobility to the whole is said to have been merely due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to want of sufficient funds. But the elevation as it is, is not wanting in dignity; and though
somewhat severe in its outlines, it gives the impression at once of simplicity without
meanness, of solidity without heaviness, and of richness without extravagance of detail.</p>

<p>The noble expanse of ground that is enclosed by the principal buildings of the
College is too large to be called a quadrangle, being six hundred and ten feet long, by
three hundred and forty feet broad, at the widest part, and it is too irregular in shape to
be called a square. It is the survival of at least five more ancient and less spacious
enclosures&mdash;(1) the Old Square,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> built in 1685, and taken down in 1751 to make room for the
present handsome granite buildings known as Parliament Square, in grateful memory of
the source from which the funds had been provided for the building; the Library Square, built
in 1698, and the oldest portion of the College buildings now in existence, and which was
itself divided into two quadrangles (2 and 3) by some new buildings standing east and west,
which were taken down in the middle of the eighteenth century. The space between the
present Dining Hall and the Fellows’ Garden was also divided into two quadrangles (4 and 5)
by the old Hall and the old Chapel, which formed a continuation of these departed “New
Buildings” to the westward, as far as the centre of Parliament Square.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE CHAPEL.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The front of the Chapel, designed by Sir William Chambers, and erected between
1787 and 1789, at a cost of £22,000, is similar to that of the Theatre that stands opposite.
Facing due south, it is ninety-six feet wide, with a deep and very handsome tetrastyle
portico, forty-eight feet wide, of the Roman Corinthian order, immediately within which is
a narthex or ante-chapel, in which is the main doorway of the building. The interior of
the Chapel is eighty feet in length, exclusive of a semicircular apse six feet in diameter,
at the north end. It is forty feet wide and forty-four feet high, having an organ loft and
semicircular gallery over the entrance, of good carved oak. In the choir are four ranges
of seats, rising gradually from the aisle to the side walls. The back row of stalls at the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and east sides are appropriated to the Fellows and Professors. The walls are wainscoted
with finely polished oak panels to the height of twelve feet, over which is a broad surbase,
from which spring the plain round-headed windows. The woodwork is elaborately carved,
and cost over £5,300. The piers between the windows are ornamented with coupled pilasters,
fluted, of the Ionic order, surmounted by an ornamented frieze and cornice. From the latter
springs the coved and groined ceiling, which is painted and enriched with florid stucco
ornaments of Italian design, similar to those employed in the same position in the Theatre.
The ceiling of the Chapel is, however, somewhat more elaborate in design. In the year
1817, the number of students resident within the walls of the College increased to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
extent, that to afford accommodation for the necessarily increased attendance at Chapel, an
iron gallery was put up along the east and west walls of the building. This was removed
in 1872, when the floor of the Chapel was laid in black and red tiles of good design,
and the marble steps and rails before the Communion Table were presented by the Provost,
Dr. Humphrey Lloyd. At the same time, the oil lamps that were fitted to the fine brass
chandeliers that hung from the east and west walls were replaced by gas burners. In
the apse are three large round-headed windows, without tracery or ornamentation, which
have recently been filled with painted glass. That on the north-west, representing the
Recapitulation of the Law by Moses, and the Restoration under Solomon, was erected in
memory of Dr. Richard Graves, by his son and other relations, in 1865. The window
facing north-east was erected in memory of the great Bishop Berkeley by the Right
Hon. R. R. Warren, when Attorney-General for Ireland, in 1867.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
THE CHAPEL.</div>
</div>

<p>The central window directly over the Communion Table was erected in memory of
Archbishop Ussher by Dr. Butcher, Bishop of Meath, in 1869. This window was painted
in Munich, and the price, £300, which was paid by Dr. Butcher, was one quarter’s salary
of the Regius Professorship of Divinity, of which office he continued for three months to
perform the duties, after his consecration as Bishop of Meath. Partly over the narthex or
ante-chapel, in the deep recess under the portico, and partly over the stalls of the
Provost and Senior Fellows, is the spacious organ gallery, in which is placed the organ.
When the present Chapel was approaching completion, a commission was given to Green,
the favourite organ-builder of George III., to provide an instrument suitable for the new
building. The price was to be five hundred guineas. And an instrument sweet rather
than powerful in tone, like most of Green’s, was accordingly placed in the organ loft. All
that now remains of this organ of Green’s is the present choir manual of only four stops.
On account of the beauty of its stopt diapason (deep, and not deformed by the usual
quintation effect), the Board retained this choir organ manual, but they were induced in
1838 to abandon the remainder to Telford, a local builder, who sold it to the Church at
Durrow, Queen’s County, where Mr. Flower, subsequently Lord Ashbrook, maintained for
some time a choir and the Cathedral service. In its place in the College Chapel, Telford
put up a Great Organ and Swell Organ, which were used in conjunction with Green’s older
manual and an imperfect pedal organ. In 1879 these two manuals and the pedals were
enlarged, altered, and greatly improved, and further additions were made by Hill &amp; Son,
of London; and the mahogany cases of Green’s instrument were enlarged to admit of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
augmentation. The organ as it stands at present contains the following stops, all effective
and brilliant, but with none of the harshness to be heard in so many organs of the
present day:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among accessory stops, &amp;c., may be counted three coupling actions, great b pedals,
swell to pedals, swell to great organ, tremolo by a horizontal bar, three hand-levers for
shifting stops of the great organ, labelled “<em>ff</em>,” “<em>mf</em>,” and “<em>p</em>.” The choir organ is placed
behind the performer, like the “Ruck-positif” of Continental examples.</p>

<p>In the ante-Chapel, on either side of the entrance door, are two slabs of white marble
let into the wall, with the following names inscribed:&mdash;Fr. Sadleir, 1851; Ric. Macdonnell,

the slabs were put up by Provost Lloyd, when it was determined that intra-mural burial
should cease. There are also in this wall ten mural tablets, with Latin inscriptions, to the
memory of Henricus Wray, ob. 1846; George Hall, 1811; Thomas Elrington, 1835; Geo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>

<h3 class="no-brk">CEMETERIUM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">In a neglected corner on the outside of the Chapel, looking towards the east, railed in,
but unprotected from the weather, is a little burying-ground, where may be seen the
tombs of some few of the Provosts and other distinguished Fellows of the College. Simple
stone slabs on the ground mark the last resting-place of Dr. Temple, Provost in 1609, and
of other unnamed and forgotten dignitaries, whose remains were removed from the old
Chapel when the new building was consecrated in 1798. The inscription on the plain flag
nearest the entrance is as clear as the day it was cut, and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A large mural tablet with Corinthian columns and alabaster mantlings, and bearing a
long and not particularly interesting inscription, is raised to the memory of Dr. Browne, the
Provost who is said to have been killed by a brickbat thrown in a College riot in 1699.
The long inscription to his many virtues is silent on this point.</p>

<p>On the left-hand side of Dr. Browne’s pompous monument is a plain stone slab in
memory of Dr. Stearne, who built the University Printing House, and was in other ways a
distinguished benefactor of the College. The very curious inscription runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the right-hand side, and like all the other monuments removed from the old

</div></div>

<p>And lastly, there is a large tomb, surmounted by a ghost-like effigy of Luke
Challoner, the real founder of the College in 1592, which occupies the most important place
in the cheerless little enclosure. The monument, houseless on the destruction of the old
Chapel, could not apparently find shelter in the new building of 1798. The recumbent
figure of soft alabaster may once have been a work of art; at a later stage it may have
been interesting to the antiquarian; at the present day it is merely remarkable as a
geological specimen, a curious illustration of the grotesque result of the action of water upon
alabaster, under certain conditions. The simple inscription on the tomb reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs80">

<p>The shorter the epitaph the greater the man!</p>

<p>The vaults under the Chapel were closed in 1867. Several of the Provosts and
Senior Fellows were buried in them; the last burial was that of Provost MacDonnell.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE THEATRE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Examination Hall, or Theatre, as it is more correctly called, was designed by
Sir William Chambers in 1777, and corresponds in its external appearance exactly with
that of the Chapel, although its interior arrangement is naturally very different. Ten
pilasters, with feeble capitals of a tasteless composite order, are disposed round the walls,
standing each one singly at intervals of twelve feet on a rustic basement ten feet high, and
supporting a handsome stucco frieze and bold cornice, the work of Italian artists. The
pilasters themselves are ornamented with stucco scroll-work of florid Roman character. From
the cornice springs the ceiling, which is also very richly ornamented in stucco, designed,
modelled, and painted in the same style as the ceiling of the Chapel, by Mayers, under the
direction of Sir William Chambers. In the five panels on the east side of the Hall are
placed full-length portraits of Queen Elizabeth, the foundress, in her state robes; of
Archbishop Ussher, Archbishop King, Bishop Berkeley, and Provost Baldwin.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> In four of
the panels on the opposite side are portraits of Edmund Burke&mdash;not by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
as is usually asserted, but by Hoppner; of William Molyneux; of Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare,
by Stewart (an American artist of some reputation); and of Dean Swift. Under the centre
panel is placed an elaborate monument (which is represented in the accompanying engraving)
to Provost Baldwin, who died in 1758. The monument is some nine feet long and about
six feet high and four feet in depth from the wall, and consists of three figures in white
marble standing over a sarcophagus of dark porphyry. It is the work of a Dublin artist of
the name of Hewetson, who executed it at his studio at Rome. The Hall is seventy feet
long to the base line of the semicircular apse, which extends to a further distance of twenty
feet, and is forty feet wide and forty-four feet high. It is lighted by three windows in the
circular apse at the upper end, and by a range of small fan-shaped windows placed over
the cornice. An elaborate gilt chandelier, designed to hold sixty wax candles, remarkably
light and graceful in character, and which belonged to the old House of Commons in College
Green, hangs in the centre of the Hall (<em>see page</em> <a href="#Page_130">130</a>). At the lower end, and over the deep
portico and doorway, is a room in which is placed a small organ that formerly stood in the
old Chapel, and which is traditionally said to have been taken out of a Spanish ship which
formed part of the Armada, and was wrecked on the coast of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>But the legend is without form or foundation. The true history of the organ and
its acquisition, however, is sufficiently interesting to be worth recording. On the 11th of
October, 1702, a fleet of twenty-five English and Dutch ships of war, under the supreme
command of Admiral Rooke, having been foiled in an attack on Cadiz, sailed into Vigo
Bay, where the combined French and Spanish fleets were then collected. A body of 2,500
soldiers, under the command of Richard, second Duke of Ormonde,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> landed under some
fortifications eight or nine miles from the town of Vigo, silenced the batteries, and captured
no less than forty pieces of cannon. A large number of the enemy’s ships were burned and
sunk by the British fleet, including six great galleons with treasure on board to the extent
of 14,000,000 pieces of eight; and a number of vessels of all kinds were taken as prizes.
Among them was a ship containing, carefully packed as part of her freight, an organ
destined in all probability for Mexico or Peru&mdash;the gift, it may be, of his most Catholic
Majesty Philip the Fifth to some favoured church in Spanish America. Rooke declined to
attack the town, and sailed away with his prizes to England. He was tried by court-martial
on his arrival, and honourably acquitted, and lived to earn undying fame two years later
by the taking of Gibraltar. But the Duke of Ormonde enjoyed all the credit of the victory
at Vigo,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and was soon after appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1703), when he
presented the organ, so strangely acquired, to Trinity College, Dublin. There was a solemn
Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul’s in honour of Ormonde’s victory, at which Queen Anne
was present, and a medal was struck in commemoration of the event, of which an example
may be seen in the College Library. The organ is said to have been originally built in the
Spanish Netherlands, and was repaired and enlarged in Dublin by Cuvillie in 1705, before
it was placed in the old Chapel. But the instrument that now stands in the gallery of the
Theatre is not the organ as it was presented by the Duke of Ormonde, or even as it left
the hands of Cuvillie. “When the University Choral Society,” writes Sir Robert Stewart,
“was founded (1837), they resolved to erect an organ for their accompaniments; and by the
aid of the Lord Primate, who contributed £50 to the cost, this was done, and an instrument
of two rows of keys and pedals was placed at the north end of the Commons Hall about
1839. But the Society, finding it useless for their purpose, sold it to the Board, who were
glad to remove it from the space which was required for Commons, Examinations, and
Lectures. The organ case which stands in the gallery of the Examination Hall contains at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
present the pipes of the organ built by Telford for the University Choral Society in 1839.
All the old Spanish pipes having been removed from its interior, the case closely resembles
all those organs built in the eighteenth century, a familiar type abounding in cherubs,
heraldic mantlings, rococo scroll-work, all being surmounted by the Royal Arms.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Another more modern legend connected with this Theatre may be worth recording.
When George IV. visited Dublin, he was entertained, as it was fitting that he should be, by
the University. And to make his way plainer from the Provost’s House to the Theatre,
where the Degrees were conferred in his presence, a part of the wall of the apse facing the
Provost’s House, where his Majesty was received, was removed, and the grand procession
entered the Hall without the necessity of going round to the main doorway. The masonry
on the outside of the Hall still bears evidence of the destruction and restoration that was
necessitated by this most loyal smoothing of the path of the royal guest.</p>

<p>One of the greatest improvements of recent times in the College precincts&mdash;a happy
artistic inspiration&mdash;has been effected at comparatively small cost either of money or of
trouble. In matters of art and taste, when the right thing is done, the result is commonly
quite out of proportion to the material magnitude of the work. In the spring of 1892, the
low granite wall, with its high iron railing, which ran from the north-east corner of the
Library Buildings to the side of the Examination Hall, was moved back some fifty feet. As
it stood before, it not only broke in upon the fine eastern façade of the Examination Hall,
ninety feet in length, but it entirely concealed the lower story of the western end of the
Library, and blocked up the main door of that building; and its lines were as meaningless
and inappropriate as they are now harmonious and satisfactory. The actual amount of
ground thus thrown into the quadrangle is only about five hundred square yards, or perhaps
one-fiftieth part of the total area of the great square of the College. But it would be
difficult to find a unit to express the magnitude of the improvement.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE CAMPANILE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The old Hall, which extended from the present Campanile in the direction of the
College gate, and parallel to the Library, had a plain end towards the west, in which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the doorway. The view of the Hall from the gateway being somewhat unsightly, a sum
of £600 was bequeathed to the College by Dean Pratt, formerly Provost, for the purpose of
having an ornamental front erected at this end of the Hall; and Dr. Gilbert had also left
by his will a further sum of £500 towards the building of a new Belfry. The Board
accordingly employed Mr. Cassels to furnish a design for the combination of the two objects.
The building was commenced in 1740, and in 1746 the new front to the Hall, with a Bell
Tower surmounted by a dome and lantern, was completed, at a total cost of £3,886: and in
1747 the great Bell of the College, which had been cast at Gloucester in 1742, and which
weighs nearly 37 cwt., was then hung in this Tower.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The upper portion of this Belfry
was removed in 1791, having been condemned as unsafe, and the entire front was taken
down in 1798. The present Belfry, or <em>Campanile</em>, as it is usually called, is the gift of
Lord John George Beresford, when Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland,
in 1852. It is an isolated monumental building in the centre of Parliament Square&mdash;an
architectural composition of three stages. The lower or basement stage is square in plan,
and of the Doric order, elevated on a bold podium or sub-basement of rusticated granite
ashlar. Each side presents an open archway between two pairs of Doric pilasters, the
pilasters being raised on pedestals, and the whole surmounted by a Doric entablature.
The keystones of arches have carved heads, representing Homer, Socrates, Plato, and
Demosthenes. This story is built of granite, with chamfered joints and raised panels,
the alternate courses of pilasters being raised in the same manner. From the blocking
of the entablature rises a stage of circular steps, the angles of blocking being occupied
by pedestals supporting figures representing Divinity, Science, Medicine, and Law. From
the upper step of this chamber rises the bell-chamber&mdash;circular in plan, and formed by
eight Corinthian columns, attached, and raised on pedestals. The space between each
pair of columns is pierced by a semicircular-headed opening, filled with ornamental ironwork.
The Corinthian entablature above is broken over each column. From this level rises the
dome, divided vertically by bands in continuation of the columns below, the intervals being
carved to resemble overlapping leaves. This dome is surmounted by a small open lantern,
formed by piers and arches; above these is a small dental cornice, finished by a smaller
dome, carved like the one below. The whole is surmounted by a gilt cross. Portland stone
is used from the upper circular step; the rest is cut granite. The total height is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a><br /><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
one hundred feet.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The gradation of the composition from the square basement to the
circular belfry stage is designed with remarkable artistic ability. It is by a series of
stepped courses, and the angles or “broaches” are happily filled by the sitting figures,
adapted to their place with great skill by the late Mr. Thomas Kirke, R.H.A., the
sculptor. The whole design, while of refined and “correct” classic detail, is of an original
character, skilfully adapted to its isolated position. The architect engaged in its erection in
1852-3 was the late Sir Charles Lanyon, R.H.A., then Mr. Lanyon, and, associated with
him, Mr. W. H. Lynn, R.H.A., both of whom continued to design buildings in the Roman
Classic manner with skill and refinement throughout a period known as that of the Gothic
revival, when this style was for a time under undeserved popular disfavour. Few architects
of the day would have been found to adapt a design, with such good judgment and
restraint, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</i> of Trinity College, and to the surrounding architecture, the
work in the previous century of Sir William Chambers. The foundation-stone of the
Campanile was laid by the donor, His Grace Lord John George Beresford, Lord Primate
of all Ireland, who was also Chancellor of the University, on the 1st of December, 1852;
and the great Bell was first rung in the new Belfry before Divine Service on Sunday,
November 26th, 1854.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE HALL.</h3>

<p class="noindent">In the early part of the eighteenth century, the want of a commodious and appropriate
Dining Hall for the use of the members of the College began to be seriously felt. In a
pamphlet of the year 1734, it is stated that attendance of the Fellows at Commons was never
as good as could be wished, and that this was attributed to the uncomfortable condition of
the then existing Hall, which was a large and spacious room, flagged, open to the air at both
ends, never warmed by fire&mdash;“in fact, the coldest room in Europe.” There was, moreover, no
Common Room in the College, in which the Fellows could pass the evening together. In
1740, Dr. Elwood, the Vice-Provost, bequeathed £1,000 for the use of the College, which the
Board determined to apply to the purpose of building a Hall. Plans were prepared by
Mr. Cassels, and the work at once put in hand; and the new building was completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in 1745. But the Hall, so erected at a total cost of £3,020, must have been unusually badly
built, for we find that at a meeting of the Board&mdash;November 13, 1758&mdash;it was ordered that
the Dining Hall should be pulled down, the foundation walls having sagged to a dangerous
extent on the laying of the new kitchen; and “Mr. Plummer, the bricklayer”&mdash;the name reads
like a jest&mdash;was dismissed from the service of the College for his negligence in connection
with the execution of the work. Mr. Plummer was apparently replaced by a better workman.
A new building was at once commenced, and although Mr. Cassels, the architect, had unfortunately
died while superintending the construction of the Duke of Leinster’s new house at
Carton, his plans were carefully followed, and the Dining Hall as we now see it was
finished about 1761, and is apparently as solid as it was the day Mr. Plummer’s successor
laid the last stone of the edifice.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> It is a detached building, in the lower part of which are
the kitchen, cellars, and other offices. It presents a handsome front, fifty feet wide, of granite,
with an angular pediment supported by six Ionic pilasters of cut granite. The main door
is approached by a broad flight of ten steps, rising to a height of five feet from the base
line, the whole width of the front.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
THE DINING HALL, VIEWED FROM LIBRARY SQUARE.</div>
</div>

<p>The clock in the pediment was for a long time the only public dial in the College,
and though it neither is nor was of any particular interest as a timepiece, it was, until
October 15th, 1870, somewhat remarkable as timekeeper, the College time being a quarter
of an hour behind the world in Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Within the building, and approached through a
spacious outer hall or vestibule, is the Dining Room or Hall proper, a fine room 70 ft.
long, 35 ft. broad, and 35 ft. high; it is wainscoted to the height of 12 ft. with oak panels
surmounted by a plain moulding. Over this, on the east side, are four large plain round-headed
windows carried quite up to the cornice, which, together with a handsome Venetian
window at the north or upper end, opposite to the entrance, and over the Fellows’ tables,
gives abundant light to the Hall. The west side is without windows, but in their place are
seven recesses, in each of which hangs a full-length portrait of some one of the many
distinguished graduates of the University. The niches are finished with broad mouldings in
stucco, and immediately over them runs a bold deep cornice, of Italian design. From this

<h3 class="no-brk">THE ENGINEERING SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The modern Venetian Palace in which the Engineering School of the College is so
nobly lodged&mdash;a building which called forth the hearty commendation of Mr. Ruskin&mdash;was
designed by the firm of Sir Thomas Deane, Son &amp; Woodward, who subsequently were the
architects of the University Museum at Oxford. The contractors were Gilbert Cockburn &amp;
Son. The building was erected in 1854-5, at a cost of £26,000. The carving of the capitals
and other stone-work was done by two Cork workmen of the name of O’Shea, who were
afterwards employed by the architects in the elaborate carvings executed for the Oxford
Museum. The style has been described as Byzantine Renaissance of a Venetian type; but
the building is in truth a highly original and beautiful conception worked out into a
harmonious and satisfactory whole. The base is, critically considered, perhaps the best part.
The exterior may suggest Venice, and the interior certainly suggests Cordova; and yet
there is nothing incongruous with the very different surroundings, nor is there in the work
any of that patchiness so often apparent in adaptations of foreign styles. It is something
in itself complete, dignified, and appropriate. The general dimensions are&mdash;length, 160ft.;
width, 91ft.; height, 49ft. to the eaves. The building is faced with granite ashlar, with
Portland stone dressings elaborately carved. The building, as is shown in the accompanying
drawing of the southern façade, looking on the College Park, is of two stories, with a broad
and richly carved string course marking the division. The round-headed windows are
disposed most effectively in groups: in the façade there is a group of four in the centre,
one on either side, and a group of three at either end; in the east and west fronts there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a group of three in the centre, and one on either side. The arches of all these spring from
square pilasters carved in florid style in Portland stone, and under the windows of the
upper story are low balustrades. Between the groups of windows in either façade are discs
of coloured marble let into the masonry, and with a circular bordure of carved Portland
stone and smaller pieces of marble; the whole harmonising with the windows and forming
a most effective ornament&mdash;simple, original, and interesting. At each corner of the building
are scroll pilasters of great beauty. The roof is low pitched, and an Italian cantilever
cornice forms the eaves.</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration represents
the main doorway opening on to the
New Square, and looking to the north.
Within the building is a spacious Hall lined
with Bath stone ashlar, with low marble
pillars and rich stone capitals, twenty-four
in number, disposed at different levels, and
supporting Moorish arches; the whole suggestive,
at least, of the architecture of
Moslem Spain. The first floor is reached
by a broad staircase of Portland stone, with
a handrail. Irish marble is used in the
pillars and Irish Serpentine in the handrail
of the staircase. Two pillars of Penzance
Serpentine are the only pieces of marble not
of Irish production.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The whole is lighted
by two low pendentive domes constructed of
coloured enamelled bricks, arranged in geometric patterns, and singularly light and free in
construction. The height from the floor is 46ft. 6in. The illustration on next page shows
the Hall and Staircase looking east. Half-way up the staircase, facing the main entrance, is
the clock in magnetic connection with the Observatory at Dunsink. It is a Regulator,
fitted with an electro-magnetic pendulum; and was put up in March 1878. An electric
current is sent out automatically every second by the standard clock at Dunsink Observatory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
This current goes first through and controls the clock which releases the Time Ball
at the Port and Docks Offices, then through the public clock in front of that office,
and on to the standard clock in Trinity College. From this clock the current is
sent out through the two timepieces over the Entrance Gate within and without the
College, and then on to the Royal Dublin Society, where it controls the clock in the
Entrance Hall. The Time Ball at the Port and Docks Office is furnished with an
electrical arrangement, designed by Sir Robert Ball,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> which automatically signals at Dunsink
the moment the Time Ball falls, so that any error in time is immediately known to the
person in charge. All the electrical arrangements were made and fitted up by Messrs.
Yeates &amp; Son of Grafton Street.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE PRINTING HOUSE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Printing House, a charming little antique temple standing at the extreme north-east
of the Library Square, was designed by Cassels, and built between 1726 and 1734,
at a cost of about £1,200, which was almost entirely provided by Dr. Stearne, Bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a><br /><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Clogher. The tetrastyle portico is of Roman Doric, nearly 8 ft. in width, with a bold cornice
and triglyphs, and a plain metope, all in fine Portland stone. And the smoke of a hundred
and fifty years has already sufficed to give it a somewhat venerable appearance. Underneath
the portico and immediately over the door is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>


<p class="pfs80" lang="la" xml:lang="la">

lies to the extreme north, and behind the northern buildings of Library Square. It was built
in 1812, and is a cold and somewhat neglected-looking quadrangle without any architectural
pretensions. It encloses just one statute acre and a-half of ground, with some grass in the
centre, fenced in by a poor railing, and planted with the scarlet flowering hawthorn. Were
the buildings covered with ivy, the square enlivened with trim green sward and flowering
shrubs, and the present railing removed, Botany Bay would still be a long way behind
picturesque Port Philip. But its name would be somewhat better justified than it is at

<h3 class="no-brk">ST. PATRICK’S WELL LANE&mdash;THE COLLEGE PARK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">In the year 1688, a most interesting monument of antiquity in Dublin was demolished
to make way for City improvements. The old Danish <em>Thingmote</em>, or Parliament Hill, an
artificial mound some forty feet high, that stood on the spot now partially occupied by
the new Ulster Bank, and not a hundred yards from the Provost’s House, was levelled with
the ground.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> And the earth of the old mound, as it was removed, was carted away and
thrown down in front of a poor street, St. Patrick’s Well Lane, facing the dreary and
neglected expanse of waste land that is now the College Park. The street so widened
and levelled was called&mdash;in honour of William of Orange Nassau, Protestant King of
England&mdash;Nassau Street. The College authorities soon afterwards built a high brick wall
on the boundary between the City and the College property; and the level of the street,
in consequence of the immense accumulation of added soil from the <em>Thingmote</em>, was left,
as it now is, some six feet higher than that of the College land which adjoins it. The
College Park was first laid out and planted with elm and plane trees in 1722; and in the
same year a wall was built on the north-eastern boundary of the College grounds, with a
gateway and lodge for a porter.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>For over a hundred years there was no great change of any kind, either in the Park
or in its surroundings; but in 1842, one of the greatest improvements that has been made
for the last half-century in the Dublin streets was effected by the College authorities, who
pulled down the ugly brick wall of 1688, and supplied its place by the present fine granite
wall, surmounted by a round coping and a handsome iron railing, which marks the boundary
of the College Park on the north side of Nassau Street. The stonework is four feet six inches
in height; the railing rises about seven feet higher, and is the work of the once well-known
firm of William Turner &amp; Co. And about the time this most admirable change was made,
Nassau Street was still further improved by the demolition of some houses and shops, of
which the leases fell in to the College, at the north-west corner of the street, and a
considerable slice of ground was given up by the College to the City to widen and improve
the street. The new stables&mdash;of fine cut granite&mdash;attached to the Provost’s House were
erected at the same time. Nassau Street, thus raised, as it were, by favour of the University,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
from a third-rate to a first-rate street, became and continued for some considerable time
to be the chosen afternoon resort of fashionable Dublin. But of late, although the street
has been greatly improved by new buildings and high-class shops, it is neglected by the
smart pleasure-seekers, who have to a great extent abandoned the town for more attractive
residences in the suburbs. And a place of public meeting&mdash;like Hyde Park or the
Boulevards, the Prater or the Prado, the Corso or the Rambla, Unter den Linden or even
“Under the Trees”&mdash;is one of the most marked wants of modern social Dublin.</p>

<p>Under the granite wall and railings of 1842, just within the Fellows’ Garden, and
opposite the northern end of Dawson Street, is the old Holy Well of St. Patrick, a sacred
spring from which St. Patrick’s Well Lane took its earlier name; now neglected and ill-cared
for, but once the most celebrated holy well in Dublin, and the resort of numerous pilgrims
and devotees from all parts of Ireland. At the extreme south-east corner of the College
precincts, opening on to Lincoln Place, is a handsome granite gateway, with large iron
gates and a porter’s lodge in cut stone, erected in 1855, in place of a mean doorway familiarly
known as “The Hole in the Wall.” This entrance, which affords the most convenient access
to all Collegians residing in the east and south-east, at present the more fashionable quarters
of the town, is of special advantage to the Medical students, whose Lecture Rooms and
Laboratories are situated just inside the gate. When these were completed in 1888, the
ground between them and the gate was newly laid out and planted. And it is proposed,
on the falling in of the leases of the row of houses between the Lincoln Place gate and
the east end of the granite wall and railings in Nassau Street, to pull down the houses
and shops, and continue the railings up to the gate in Lincoln Place, a distance of 120
yards; an improvement which will be equally great both to the College and the adjacent
City property. One of the most striking views of the College grounds is from the windows
of Kildare Street Club, the finest house in Nassau Street, and itself a striking object as
seen from the College Park.</p>

and would be, perhaps, the finest in the College, were it not for the ugly back view of a

off the view of and from the College Park. The Medical School has a frontage of 140 feet
to the west, and two wings, extending 150 feet eastward, at right angles to the façade.
The whole of this 440 feet is in fine cut granite. The main door is in the centre of the
principal elevation, and three tiers of fourteen windows, those in
the first and third stories being square, those in the second story
round-headed, are disposed in pairs, without ornamentation or special
architectural feature of any kind. Yet the building, if somewhat
severe in character, is appropriate to the objects for which it
is destined, and is, as a whole,
entirely satisfactory. For six
feet from the ground the
masonry is of rustic ashlar;
from thence to the eaves, fine
cut granite. Behind the
building, and enclosed by the

pumping engine, by which the
Park is kept dry even in the
wettest weather. The water
is drained into a reservoir, and
pumped from thence through
iron pipes into the river Liffey,
which at low tide only is some
feet below the College Park.
In comparatively recent times
all this part of the grounds
was swampy, and in wet winters impassable. And that part of the Park between the

<p class="noindent">The Anatomical Museum, built in 1875-6 from the design of Mr. J. M‘Curdy, for a
long time architect to the College, is placed some seventy feet to the north of the Medical
School, has a façade of 150 feet looking west, and a depth of forty-five feet. It is
constructed of cut granite, without ornament or special features. Two doors and nine
windows on the ground floor are surmounted by eleven windows on the upper story, all
square, simple, solid, and harmonious. In this building are found the Museum collections
both of Anatomy and of Natural History, and on the ground floor is the Anthropometric
Laboratory, where measurements and records are taken on a somewhat more extended
plan than that introduced by Captain Francis Galton at South Kensington. And a metric
system of notation has been adopted similar to that in use on the Continent of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
especially in Paris, and lately introduced into the Anthropometric Department of the

THE DISSECTING ROOM.</div>
</div>

<p>The Anatomical School
presents the great advantage of
having all its Lecture Rooms
and Laboratories on the ground
floor.</p>

<p>The Dissecting Room is
large, well lighted, and well
ventilated&mdash;so spacious and so
well arranged that three hundred
students can work at the same
time without inconvenience. It
is in every respect well suited
for the work that is carried on,
and presents none of that dinginess
so generally characteristic
of rooms of the kind. It is
lighted by the electric light.
The floor is of oak parquet.
Round the walls are a series
of cases, in which are placed
permanent typical specimens,
which are largely used by the
students. Every inch of wall
space above these cases is made
use of for framed plates and
diagrams appropriate to the
subjects, and in the centre of
the room on lofty pedestals
stand two statues, the Venus of Milo and the Boxer, bearing witness to the fact that
Anatomy has artistic as well as medical aspects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bone Room and the Lecture Theatre are entered directly from the Dissecting
Room. The Bone Room is a lofty room surrounded by a gallery. On the floor, osteological
specimens are arranged in revolving cases on long narrow tables. Few anatomical
departments can boast of so numerous and so varied an assortment of teaching preparations.
The gallery is chiefly devoted to specimens which bear upon the applications of anatomy
to the practice of medicine. It is here also that are displayed (1) the large series of
models prepared in the department to illustrate cerebral growth and the cranio-cerebral
topography of the child and the adult; (2) the series of models representing the anatomy
of inguinal hernia, also prepared in the department; (3) the mesial sections of the four
anthropoid apes&mdash;gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbon&mdash;preparations which are unique.
The Theatre is capable of seating 400 students. It is not handsome; but it is comfortable
and, most important of all, its acoustic property admirably well adapted for the purpose
for which it was designed. There are also a Museum of Surgical and Medical Pathology,
and one of Materia Medica.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE CHEMICAL SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The Chemical Department adjoins the Medical School, and is in the southern part
of the buildings, just within the Lincoln Place gate of Trinity College. The new Lecture
Theatre of the School is situated between two groups of Laboratories, and is fitted with all
modern appliances for lecture-illustration in the various branches of Chemical Science. The
seats are numbered, and are assigned in the order of entry for the different courses of lectures.
Behind the Lecture Theatre is a large Demonstration Room, fitted with Assay and Cupelling
furnaces and other apparatus, and beyond are the Laboratories for Qualitative Analysis
and Preparation. These consist of four lofty and well-ventilated rooms, capable of
accommodating 112 students, who work at compartments fully provided with the necessary
apparatus tests and materials. Off the larger room of this series are (1) a special
sulphuretted-hydrogen chamber, with separate ventilation, (2) a general store, and (3) cases
of apparatus used at lectures. These Laboratories, as well as the Lecture Theatre and other
rooms, are heated by means of hot water pipes, and the special ventilation required for
carrying off fumes, &amp;c., from the different compartments is obtained by the powerful draught
of a chimney stack, sixty feet high, connected with the furnace of the heating apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
The Quantitative and Research Laboratories and their related rooms are at the east front
of the new buildings. The main Laboratory is a fine room, provided with all modern
appliances, and adjoining it are special rooms for (<em>a</em>) Balances and other instruments of
precision, together with the special apparatus required for Quantitative Analysis; (<em>b</em>) for

<p class="drop-capx">The close of the sixteenth century was a brilliant period in the history
of the English people. Three years before the measure for the
foundation in Dublin of a College “whereby knowledge and civility might
be increased” passed the Great Seal, the “Invincible Armada” had suffered
disastrous defeat at the hands of English seamen. The Queen, who had
“confirmed to her people that pillar of liberty, a free press,” had shown herself possessed of
a deeper sympathy with her subjects than enemies were willing to allow her, and the
determined spirit of her ancestors&mdash;determined whether in the good cause or the bad&mdash;had
been displayed at a crisis of supreme gravity. It was a good omen for the future of the
“College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,” that it could write beneath the portrait of
this sovereign, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hujusce Collegii Fundatrix.</i>”</p>

<p>The history of the University founded by Elizabeth is the history of the greatest
institution in this country, which, amidst so much failure, has been a permanent and
indisputable success. During the dark ages of Ireland’s confusion and misery, the lamp of
learning and culture was here kept alight. No small achievement will this seem in the eyes
of those to whom the social and political condition of the country, during the two hundred
years which followed the granting of the Charter to the “mother of a University” in Dublin,
are even superficially known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1591, the meadow land and orchards of the Monastery of All Hallows, near the
city, which had become the property of the Corporation upon the dissolution of all such
establishments by Henry VIII., were transferred to the Provost and Fellows appointed
under the Royal Seal; and where, fifty years before, the brotherhood of Prior and Monks had
passed their days in the quiet seclusion of a life apart from the busy world of ambitious
men, there now began the quick and vivid play of thought and feeling which mark a
University in which the minds of the future leaders of the people are moulded and exercised.
The more prominent names in the list of the graduates of Elizabeth’s College are abundant
proof of the paramount position of influence from the first maintained by it in every
department of the public life of the country, and the importance of its work in training the
men who have been in the van of progress in culture and science, and among the leaders
of every political movement in Ireland; many of them, too, in the wider field offered by
England, and, in these later days, in the still wider field of the colonies and dependencies
under the Crown. The traditions and prestige attached to such an institution are inalienable,
and it will indeed be strange if any statesman attempt, as is sometimes apprehended, the
impossible task of disturbing or transferring them. The greater part of the history of
Ireland since the opening of the seventeenth century can be read in the more public lives
of the alumni of Trinity College.</p>

<p>Oxford, it is said, has been the University of great movements; Cambridge, of great
men. Genius indeed is not the outcome or resultant of academic life and traditions, while
intellectual and social movements may in a measure be traced to such sources. Thus may
Oxford fairly claim for herself influences more wide-reaching than her sister, although she
cannot boast an equally distinguished family. It must indeed be remembered that genius is
resentful of restrictions, and the debt acknowledged to any University by its greatest sons
is usually but a limited one. To her poets, Landor and Shelley, Oxford was a harsh
stepmother, and many a young man, afterwards to be famous, left the banks of Cam
without gratitude and without regret. Nevertheless, a distinctive type of culture, often of
directing power, even though resisted, prevails at every great centre of learning. If the
dignity of a seat of learning is to be determined by the intellectual splendour of the names
associated with it, Oxford must give place to Dublin as well as to Cambridge. There is
no Oxonian to rank with Swift or Burke.</p>

<p>But all such comparisons are idle; the Irish sister of the two great English Universities
has had a far different career, and her type of culture is essentially distinctive, and not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of another. Oxford, “the home of lost causes and forsaken beliefs and impossible loyalties,”
has a charm all her own. The old Irish College does not lie, like that “Queen of
Romance, steeped in sentiment, and whispering from her towers the last enchantments of
the middle ages.” To sentiment she has ever been a stranger, and she lies at the heart of
a metropolis. But perhaps the atmosphere of sentiment is not compatible with that of reason,
and Dublin has been the home of intellectual sanity. Unadorned by creeper or “ivy
serpentine,” no quaint windows or secluded cloisters bring to the thoughtful student of “Old
Trinity” visions of the monks of the Monastery of All Saints; and no one who knows her
history, or has breathed her keen disillusionising air, would conceive as possible the fostering
of an intellectualism such as that of Newman under the shadow of her Greek porticoes.
Like her architecture, the mind of the University of Dublin has been more Greek than that
of her English sisters. The spirit of Plato dwelt in Berkeley as it never could have done
in a thinker educated in a University dominated by the methods of Bacon. In Edmund
Burke the philosophical statesmanship of the Athenian Republic was revived as the “last
enchantments of the middle ages,” with all their witchery, could never have revived it.
Dublin has never given herself over to the idols of the forum or the market-place, nor
worshipped at the shrine of utilitarian philosophies. She has not swung incense in the
chapel of Hobbes or Herbert Spencer, nor bowed the knee to a dictator in the Vatican of
science. She has betrayed as little enthusiasm for the cause of the Stuarts as for that of
Pusey and Keble. When we call to mind her position in the heart of a country misunderstood
and misgoverned for centuries, we cannot but marvel that she has so serenely kept
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i> between political, philosophical, and social extremes. At once less conservative
and less radical than her sisters, a dry intellectual light has been her guide. It may be that
the native humour of the soil has preserved her from the follies of dogmatism&mdash;ecclesiastical,
scientific, political, or literary,&mdash;and equally so from frenzied devotion to hopeless causes or
extravagant theories. Stranger to sentiment, and no “Queen of Romance,” I cannot think
that an enemy could deny beauty to the solemn stateliness of her quadrangles. In the quiet
of moonlit nights, or when the summer sun shines upon the grey walls and the green of
grass and foliage in her courts and park, there are few so unimpressionable as to remain
insensible to her dignity and loveliness. But her truest dignity is in the intellectual honour
of her sons.</p>

<p>Among the very first batch of graduates in these the infant days of the College a
great personality appears. At the first Public Commencements held in 1601, on Shrove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Tuesday, in St. Patrick’s Cathedral, “Sir Ussher,” one of the students entered at the first
matriculation examination, was admitted to his Master’s degree. James Ussher was of a
family that had been resident in Ireland since the time of King John, and on both sides
of the house his ancestors had held important public offices. His grandfather had been
Speaker of the Irish House of Commons,
and his uncle, afterwards Primate of Ireland,
while Archdeacon in Dublin had had much
to do with the foundation of the Irish
University. “Sir Ussher” became Fellow
and Proctor in due time, and while still
under age was by a faculty ordained Priest
and Deacon. His first recorded visit to
England was that upon the errand in which
he met with Sir Thomas Bodley buying
books for the Oxford Library which now
bears his name. Two of the greatest
Libraries of the United Kingdom were thus
associated in their foundation. The energy
and extraordinary abilities of Ussher were
soon very widely recognised, and he was
offered the Provostship in 1609, which position,
however, he declined. On the occasion
of his next visit to England, he bore a
letter of recommendation to King James
from the Lord Deputy and Council, it being
supposed that the King was prejudiced
against him. The gifts and learning which
had made him so conspicuous a figure in
Ireland did not fail to impress the King, who
appointed him Bishop of Meath, “a Bishop of his own making,” as he said. He preached,
while in London, before the Commons and at St. Margaret’s. During his tenure of the
Bishopric he was very prominent in public affairs, and in 1625 he was raised to the
Primacy. While occupied with the high civil and episcopal duties of his many offices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
he was extending that learning which placed him at the head of the scholars of the
day, and for which he is still read and honoured. Burnet writes of him as a man “of a
most amazing diligence and exactness, joined with great judgment. Together with his
vast learning, no man had a better soul and a more apostolical mind. In his conversation
he expressed the true simplicity of a Christian, for passion, pride and self-will, and the
love of the world seemed not so much as in his nature; so that he had all the innocence
of the dove in him. He was certainly one of the greatest and best men that the age,
perhaps the world, has produced.” Selden spoke of him as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vir summa pictate, judicio
singulari, usque ad miraculum doctus.</span>”</p>

<p>To compass, even in a volume, the bare record of the important public acts of Ussher
while Archbishop of Armagh, would be a difficult task. He is the towering figure of his time,
and seems to stand as centre to its history, overshadowing both churchmen and statesmen of
ordinary stature, a period which reckoned among its prominent men educated in Dublin such
scholars as Dudley Loftus, and such antiquarians as Sir James Ware. In 1640 the Primate
was forced by the troubles of the time to go for a sojourn to England, which proved to be
for the rest of his life. He was taken into the counsels of King Charles about the
modification of Episcopal government such as to satisfy Presbyterians, and propounded a
scheme with that view. From this time he was one of the King’s confidential advisers, and
warned him against the signing of the Bill of Attainder against Strafford. When he knew
that it had been done, Ussher broke out with “O sir! what have you done? Pray God your
Majesty may never suffer by signing this Bill!” He bore the King’s last messages to
Strafford, and attended him in prison and to the scaffold, bearing back the report of his
execution to Charles.</p>

<p>At this period of his life, an unhappy and stormy one, he had many invitations from
abroad; among others, from Cardinal Richelieu, who offered him a pension and free exercise
of his religion in France. After the manner of the Greek heroes, these two princes of the
Church interchanged gifts, the Cardinal sending Ussher a gold medal, and the Primate, in
return, two Irish-greyhounds. The invitation to settle in France was renewed by the Queen
Regent, Anne of Austria; but this, among other offers, such as that of a Chair in the
University of Leyden, he declined. During the civil war his experiences were most unhappy,
and although reverenced by the chiefs of the Parliamentary party as a man of astonishing
genius and unswerving rectitude, his property was frequently plundered, and his life, if not
actually endangered, rendered hopeless and miserable by the uncertainties and distress of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
condition. He suffered, indeed, at the hands of the Government; for when summoned to the
Assembly of Divines at Westminster by Parliament, he declined to present himself, and
was, as a consequence, denounced, and his library confiscated; but by the help of influential
friends it was restored to him. Ussher’s learning was so wide and deep, especially in
theology, that in many instances the researches and discoveries of modern scholars have only
served to confirm his judgments. A striking example of his acumen is to be found in his
edition of Ignatius and Polycarp. Observing that three English writers of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries cite Ignatius in a different form from what was then known, but
agreeing with citations made by Eusebius and others, he was led to divine the existence of
copies of the different form in England. Search was accordingly made, and his forecast
was verified by the discovery of two Latin versions&mdash;one in Caius College, Cambridge,
while a Greek text corresponding was recovered in Florence. This is the text of Ignatius
now generally received, and has recently been established as the true text, as against that
current before Ussher’s time, by the late Bishop Lightfoot, who speaks of this work as
“showing not only marvellous erudition, but also the highest critical genius.” The great
Primate’s sagacity, not only in matters of scholarship but in matters of State, was regarded
in his own day as approaching that of inspiration, and a volume of his predictions
respecting public affairs was actually published.</p>

<p>The Parliament relented towards Ussher so far as to vote him a pension in his later
years, which was, however, but irregularly paid. The death of his royal master was a great
blow to Ussher, and he ever after kept the momentous day of execution as a fast. A
few years before his death he published his <cite>Old Testament Chronology</cite>, whence is taken the
Table commonly inserted in Bibles. The great Protector sent for him, treated him with
marked courtesy, and was indeed almost persuaded by him to grant a certain toleration to
the Episcopal worship, but finally refused any such boon to his “implacable enemies;”
showing himself, as Ussher tersely described him, a man possessed of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">intestina non viscera.</span>”
At his death the honours of a public funeral were ordered by Cromwell, who, with all his
sternness against his foes, could not but reverence the moral grandeur of the man; and
the service of his own church was read over the grave of the greatest churchman of his
time, in the chapel of St. Erasmus.</p>

<p>While Dodwell, that prolific author, whose name is also connected with the Camden
Professorship bestowed on him by the University of Oxford, was a Fellow of Trinity
lecturing in logic, his most brilliant pupil, soon to become a friend, was William King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Among his contemporaries several names of note occur in the College records&mdash;Tate and
Brady; Dillon, Earl of Roscommon; Leslie, Denham, Peter Browne, Robert Boyle, and Wilson,
the author of <cite>Sacra Privata</cite>. But King has claims to more than passing notice. A
churchman of whom Swift, a warm admirer, could write as follows, can have been no
common man&mdash;“He spends his time in the practice of all the virtues that can become
public or private life. So excellent a person may justly be reckoned among the greatest
and most learned prelates of this age.”</p>

</div>

<p>King was of a Scotch Presbyterian family, his father having settled in Ulster
after his excommunication for refusal to sign
the Covenant. He betrayed in his infant
years an aversion to the mechanical lessons
of his schoolmistress, and suffered much
whipping as a consequence. The art of
reading came upon him later quite as a
surprise, as he suddenly found himself able
to make sense of the combinations of letters
which had baffled him under the tuition of
an orthodox school <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>. During his
career in College he lived as a Spartan.
“I scarce had twenty pounds,” he tells us
in an unpublished autograph memoir preserved
in Armagh Diocesan Library, “in all
the six years I spent in College, save from
the College (Scholarship). Yet herein do I
acknowledge God’s providence that I was
able to appear <em>nearly</em> all that time decently
drest and sufficiently fed.” Although without
definite religious opinions, since as a child
he had received no instruction, by study and conversation with men of weight and learning
in the University he came to have that settled faith which drew him to the ministry of the
Church, and remained with him all through life. Thus King’s debt to Trinity College was
a large one; he owed to her not only the intellectual but the spiritual training which
determined his life and character. When ordained Priest, he was appointed Chaplain to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Archbishop of Tuam. The change from the narrow fare of his life in College to that of
the Palace, where a “dinner of sixteen dishes and a supper of twelve, with abundant
variety of wines and other generous liquors,” were the usual diet, affected his health.
“The issue was, that before I had begun to dream of ill effects,” he says quaintly, “I was
taken with the gout.”</p>

<p>Archbishop Parker, who had formed a high estimate of King’s powers, appointed him,
soon after his own translation to Dublin, to the Chancellorship of St. Patrick’s, at that
juncture of affairs when the Duke of York, heir-presumptive to the Crown, declared himself
a Roman Catholic. In 1683 he was sent to Tunbridge Wells to try a course of the waters
for his health, and fell into acquaintance with many political persons. Party spirit was then
running very high, and considerable excitement prevailed over the revocation of the charters
of certain cities. He felt it to be his duty to support the King, so that he might not be
driven to seek support from the unprincipled politicians of the day. This support was,
however, only conditional upon rational and legal action on the King’s part. When the
crisis came in the next reign, and it was imperative that some side should be taken in the
contest between James and the Prince of Orange, King came to the conclusion that in the
illegal and unjustifiable action of James there was ample reason for the transference of his
allegiance to the champion of the Protestant party.</p>

<p>At this time, when the confusion and apprehensions of the clergy drove many of
them to England for refuge, the affairs of the Church in Ireland were wholly managed by
King and Bishop Dopping, an ex-Fellow of Trinity. Archbishop Marsh, indeed, left
everything in the hands of King as his commissary, and the latter’s position became one of
great responsibility and danger. With many others, he was thrown into prison in Dublin
Castle, and, although released in a few months, was again in the following year imprisoned,
until the victory of the Boyne set him at liberty. As Dean of St. Patrick’s he preached at
a thanksgiving service for the victory in his Cathedral, at which the King was present; and
when it was told his Majesty, in answer to enquiry, that the preacher’s name was William
King, he remarked, smiling, that their names were both alike&mdash;King William and William
King. On his appointment to the Bishopric of Derry, which followed close upon the
Revolution, he showed his great administrative abilities in the government of the See, which
had been terribly impoverished by the war. As he had been the first to declare in public
speech to which king his allegiance was due, so was he the first author of a history of
the time, <cite>State of the Protestants in Ireland</cite>, in which he vindicated the lawfulness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
William’s interposition between James and his subjects; a book spoken of by Burnet as “a
copious history of the government of Ireland during the reign, which is so well received,
and so universally acknowledged to be as truly as it is fairly written, that I refer my
readers to the account of these matters which is fully and faithfully given by that learned
and zealous prelate.”</p>

<p>As Archbishop of Dublin, King proved himself statesman no less than prelate, as the
history of the times clearly evidence. When in his seventy-fifth year, the See of Armagh
became vacant. To Swift, who wrote warmly expressing his hope that King would be
promoted to Armagh, he replied: “Having never asked anything, I cannot now begin to
do so, when I have so near a prospect of leaving the station in which I am another way.”
But there is little doubt that the appointment of Boulter, an Englishman, was not
acceptable to him, for he received the Primate at his first visit, seated, with the words&mdash;in
which the jest did not disguise their bitterness,&mdash;“My Lord, I am sure your Grace will
forgive me, because you know I am too old to rise.” This practice of importing Englishmen
to fill the greater Sees of Ireland prevailed until a few years ago, and can scarcely be
described as other than gratuitously insulting to the clergy of that Church in this Country.
King was eminently ecclesiastic and prelate, wise, strong, and masterful, possessed of many
of the gifts which go to make up a great statesman. Not such
a scholar as Ussher, he was more fitted by nature to play a
part among living men, although, as his great work, <cite>De Origine
Mali</cite>, proves, he was a subtle thinker no less than a far-sighted
man of action.</p>

<p>Bishops Downes and St. George Ashe and Dr. Delany
are among the prominent Churchmen of this period who were
ex-Fellows of Trinity. This is the Dr. Delany frequently
mentioned in Primate Boulter’s letters, and in the works of
Dean Swift. Of the Scholars of the day, William Molyneux,
the philosophical friend of Locke, was in the first rank. He it
was who founded the Society in Dublin on the plan of the Royal
Society in London, which, although dispersed during the troubles of the war between James
and William, may rightly be considered the parent of the present Royal Society of Ireland.
He represented the University in Parliament, and was a public man of mark, although by
natural bent of mind a mathematician and philosopher. Against Hobbes he carried on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
controversy in support of Theism. Molyneux wrote many scientific works of great value,
and one political pamphlet which is historical&mdash;<cite>The Case of Ireland’s being bound by Acts
of Parliament made in England</cite>.</p>

<p>Like his own Gulliver among the Liliputians, the
gigantic figure of Swift dominates his age. There is no
man in history whose character and life is a more
fascinating study, or whose personality awakens such
powerful and varied emotions. We are awed by the
splendour of the intellectual achievement which created
and peopled a new world in the travels of <cite>Gulliver</cite>,
which dominated from Laracor Parsonage the counsels
of statesmen and the fortunes of governments, and which
could, in the <cite>Drapier’s Letters</cite>, fan the imagination of a
people to the white heat of revolutionary action. We
turn to his private life and read his letters, and awe
gives place to pity, not far removed from affection, for
the proud heart, sore with all unutterable and measureless
desires, and of gentlest tenderness to a simple girl. Too proud to be vain; too conscious
of the vanities of the things of ambition to be ambitious; too constant and open a friend
to care for the friendships of the shallow or conceited&mdash;in short,
too consummate master of the world to care for the things
of the world, like Alexander, despair took hold on him because
the inexorable limits of time and space left him without a sphere
worthy the exercise of the power he felt within him. There was
something more than misanthropy in the man to whom the
gentle Addison, in sending a copy of his <cite>Travels in Italy</cite>, could
write:&mdash;“To Jonathan Swift, the most agreeable companion, the
truest friend, and the greatest genius of his age, this work is
presented by his most humble servant, the author.”</p>

</div>

<p>There was little in the eighteenth century of spiritual
fervour or moral enthusiasm. The mental fashion of the times
was a cynical rationalism, of no depth, because unsupported by any genuine desire for truth.
Swift, while he hated the shallowness of the prevailing mood of mind, caught the contagion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and could not altogether shake himself free from its effects, but became in his far more
honest and more terrible cynicism profoundly contemptuous of the cynics. Stella’s smile
alone, like a ray of light, ever broke the leaden grey of the sky over his head. When that
star faded, there was nothing left for which to live, “the long day’s work was done,” and
death was a friend leading to a rest&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Swift&mdash;in name ecclesiastic, in reality statesman and leader of men&mdash;marks the transition
period from churchmen to poets, orators, and
men of letters, in the remarkable grouping of
the great names among the graduates of
Dublin. Boswell records Johnson’s estimate
of three of the “Irish clergy” of whom I have
spoken. “Swift,” said he, “was a man of
great parts, and the instrument of much
good to his country; Berkeley was a profound
scholar, as well as a man of fine
imagination; but Ussher,” he said, “was the
great luminary of the Irish Church, and a
greater no Church could boast of&mdash;at least
in modern times.”</p>

Thomas Southerne Esq<sup>r</sup>.</div>
</div>

<p>The great churchmen of the early years
of the University were followed by the great
dramatists. Save to the faithful in matters
of literature, the name of Southerne, like that
of many of his predecessors of the age of
Elizabeth, is a name alone&mdash;“stat nominis
umbra,”&mdash;and that although he counted Gray
and Dryden among his admirers, and was the first author whose plays were honoured by a
second and third night of representation, Shakespeare himself not excepted. In Southerne is
to be found the last flicker of the passion and fervour of the great dramatic period of our
literature. As we read, we are startled here and there by the “gusto of the Elizabethan
voice,” the unmistakable tone which has “somewhat spoiled our taste for the twitterings” of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
modern verse. The great actress still lives, Helen Faucit, Lady Martin, whose impersonation
of Isabella in the “Fatal Marriage” is vividly remembered by our older playgoers as one of
the most powerful of her parts. But we of this generation can know nothing of Southerne
save in the study. To the best known of his plays a place of unique honour belongs.
The poet is ever foremost in the holy cause of freedom, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and “Oronooko” is'">and “Oroonoko” is</ins> the first work
in English which denounced the slave trade. The story of the tragedy is said to be literally
true down to the minutest details. Much court was paid to this “Victor in Drama” in
his old age; and his person, no less than his reputation, seems to have demanded it, for
he was “of grave and venerable aspect, accustomed to dress in black, with silver sword and
silver locks.” To him, on his 81st birthday, Pope wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Resigned to live, prepared to die,</p>
<p class="verse0">With not one sin but poetry;</p>
<p class="verse0">This day Time’s fair account has run</p>
<p class="verse0">Without a blot to eighty-one.</p>
<p class="verse0">Kind Boyle before his poet lays</p>
<p class="verse0">A table with a cloth of bays,</p>
<p class="verse0">And Ireland, mother of sweet singers,</p>
<p class="verse0">Presents her harp still to his fingers.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the Dublin class-rooms two of the comic dramatists of the Restoration obtained
their scholarship. The intellectual splendour of William Congreve did not more indisputably
place him at the head of that coterie of letters than his learning and culture
made him the most courted gentleman of the period&mdash;“the splendid Phœbus Apollo of the
Mall.” “His learning,” says Macaulay, “does great honour to his instructors. From his
writings, it appears not only that he was well acquainted with Latin literature, but that
his knowledge of the Greek poets was such as was not in his time common, even in a
College.” For those who feel with Charles Lamb, when he says, speaking of the comedy of
the last century&mdash;“I confess, for myself, I am glad for a season to take an airing beyond
the diocese of the strict conscience,” Congreve must always remain prince of wits. He is
as absolute master of his domain as Shakespeare of his. We do not now rank him, as
Dryden and Johnson did, with the world’s master-mind&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“ ... Heaven, that but once was prodigal before,</p>
<p class="verse0">To Shakespeare gave as much, she could not give him more;”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">but we cannot refuse him an absolute supremacy in the narrower sphere of his genius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Congreve’s laurels were all reaped at the age of thirty. The “Old Bachelor” was produced
when the author was but twenty-three, and that most perfect of English comedies of
manners, “Love for Love,” when he was twenty-five. No such dialogue, for brilliancy, subtlety,
intellectual finish, and flavour, was ever before heard. We who read cannot feel surprised
that its sparkle should have dazzled the critics into the language of exaggerated panegyric.
The “Mourning Bride” was the only essay in tragedy made by the man who, in Voltaire’s
words, “raised the glory of comedy to a
greater height than any English writer before
or since.” Such a genius as Congreve could
not fail absolutely, and though most of us
know it only in its first line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast;”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">or perhaps by the passage which Johnson
overpraised as “the most poetical passage
from the whole mass of English poetry,”
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse0">“How reverend is the face of this tall pile,”&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<div class="caption">
M<sup>r</sup> William Congreve.</div>
</div>

<p>Congreve’s career is a striking contrast
to that proverbially assigned by fortune to
the man of letters. Patronage from rival
ministers placed him in various sinecure
offices, and he died possessed of a large
fortune. His funeral was that of a Prince.
His body lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and the greatest Peers of England
were the bearers of the pall.</p>

<p>Farquhar’s career was less happy than that of Congreve, if indeed success be happiness.
The genial Irish spirit of the gallant gentleman could not carry his life beyond its thirtieth
year. Over-exertion, necessitated by the impecuniosity inevitable to a nature akin to
Goldsmith’s, undermined his health, and, like many another, in seeking to save his life he lost
it. To Wilks, the actor, he wrote in a characteristic vein during his last illness:&mdash;“Dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Bob, I have not anything to leave thee to perpetuate my memory but two helpless girls.
Look upon them sometimes, and think of him that was, to the last moment of his life,
thine, George Farquhar.”</p>

<p>In the “Beaux’ Stratagem” and the “Recruiting Officer,” there is far less of the prurient
indecency characterising the period than in the comedies of any other member of the famous
group. Farquhar’s broad humour resembles that of Chaucer and Shakespeare; it bears no
relation to that of Wycherley. A gentleman of letters, he carried with him into his
plays the happy lovable disposition of the land of his birth, and the gay indifference to
fortune’s buffets of the military adventurer. “He was becoming gayer and gayer,” said
Leigh Hunt, “when death, in the shape of a sore anxiety, called him away as if from a
pleasant party, and left the house ringing with his jest.”</p>

<p>Among the poets patronised by Frederick, Prince of Wales, at the beginning of the
eighteenth century was Henry Brooke, afterwards better known as a novelist by his <cite>Fool of
Quality</cite>, published in the same year as the now famous <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>. Brooke, in a
remarkable poem entitled “Universal Beauty,” wherein every aspect of Nature is described
with scientific exactness, anticipating the manner of Darwin in the “Loves of the Plants,” gave
promise of a poetic future and fame to which he never attained. In early life a friend of
Swift, Pope, and Chesterfield, as a man of letters he was widely known and respected
for his public spirit and generous disposition, as well as for the high merit of his work.</p>

<p>Ireland has never produced a more truly original poet than Thomas Parnell, the
author of “The Hermit.” After he had acquired in Trinity College the classical training
which, in the estimation of Goldsmith, placed him among the most elegant scholars of the
day, a country parsonage received him into an oblivion which would have been final but for
the kindly encouragement of Swift and Pope. So modest and diffident a man could never
have emerged from the obscurity of his position in life unaided by some helping hand. As
it was, his poems were not published, except in a posthumous edition by his great
contemporary last mentioned. Although unable wholly to effect escape from the influences
of the artificial school of the poetry of the so-called Augustan age, there is more real feeling
naturally expressed, more genuine poetic sweetness, in Parnell’s “Hymn to Contentment,” or
his “Night Piece on Death,” than in any other verse of his time. Without Pope’s incisive
vigour or precision, he sounds a note more pure and exquisite, a note which appeals to
the modern lover of poetry as Pope’s keen intelligence and perfection of phrase can
never do.</p>

Berkeley.</div>
</div>

<p>At Kilkenny School, the Eton of Ireland, where Congreve and Swift had also been
pupils, George Berkeley received his early education <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub ferula</i> a Dr. Hinton. At the age
of fifteen he entered Trinity, and soon after became Scholar and Fellow of the house.
Mathematics chiefly occupied the
attention of the more eminent
scholars of the day, but the larger
problems claimed Berkeley’s allegiance.
The philosophical issues
raised by Locke and Malebranche
had given a new impulse to the
study of metaphysics, now emancipated
from the fetters of scholasticism.
Dublin was abreast of the
thought of the time, for Locke’s
<cite>Essay</cite> was adopted as a text-book
immediately on its publication, and
is still a part of the course in Logics.
On accepting the Deanery of Derry
in 1724, Berkeley resigned all his
College offices, but before that time
his best known work had been done.
<cite>The New Theory of Vision</cite> and
<cite>The Principles of Human Knowledge</cite>
are the direct outcome of his
thought while a Junior Fellow of
Trinity. The originality of Berkeley’s
mind was equalled by its
purity. The “good Berkeley,” as
Kant calls him, charmed, as some
rare spirits have the power to charm society which cared nothing for his theories, no less
than philosophical friends and foes. To him the satiric vivisector Pope ascribed “every virtue
under Heaven;” and Swift, misanthropist and scorner of friendship, made him a confidential
friend. In some men, as has often been remarked, there resides a nameless power, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
effluence of a character at once strong and good. No less a philosopher in life than in
theory, no word of bitterness has ever been breathed against one of the fairest fames in
history. In what exquisite words he declined, when Bishop of Cloyne, to apply for the
Archiepiscopal See of Armagh: “I am no man’s rival or competitor in this matter. I am
not in love with feasts, and crowds, and visits, and late hours, and strange faces, and a
hurry of affairs often insignificant. For my own private satisfaction, I had rather be master
of my time than wear a diadem.” But in the interest of others he was willing to spend
that time. Like every other idealist thinker, he had his Utopia. “He is an absolute
philosopher,” wrote Swift to Lord Carteret, “with regard to money, titles, and power, and
for three years past has been struck with a notion of founding a University at Bermudas
by a charter from the Crown.”</p>

<p>On May the 11th, 1726, the Commons voted “That an humble address be presented
to his Majesty, that out of the lands in St. Christopher’s, yielded by France to Great Britain
by the Treaty of Utrecht, his Majesty would be graciously pleased to make such grant for
the use of the President and Fellows of the College of St. Paul in Bermuda as his Majesty
shall think proper.” The College, though here named, was never established, but the glow
of anticipated success was the inspiration of prophetic and noble verse&mdash;such verse as Mr.
Palgrave tells us is written by thoughtful men who practise the art but little.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">

<p class="verseq">“In happy climes, the seat of innocence,</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the critics have omitted to mention Berkeley among the stylists, probably
because of the subject-matter of his work; but as a master of language he alone of the
philosophers ranks with Plato. A felicity of style, consisting in perfect naturalness and
perfect fitness in the choice of words, has been a birthright of great Irishmen. There
is perhaps no surer test of delicacy of moral fibre or of intellectual precision than a
refinement of touch in language, such as that of Goldsmith and Berkeley.</p>

<p>After the disappointment in the matter of the University in Bermuda, Berkeley
devoted himself once more to Philosophy. With Queen Caroline he was so great a favourite
that the royal command frequently brought him to the Palace; and when through some
official hitch he was disappointed of the Deanery of Down, the Queen signified her pleasure
that, since “they would not suffer Dr. Berkeley to be a Dean in Ireland, he should be
a Bishop,” and in 1734 appointed him to the See of Cloyne.</p>

<p>His letter to the Roman Catholic Bishops of Ireland shows the large spirit of charity
with which he exercised his episcopal office. Traditions of his loved and cherished presence
still linger about the Palace of Cloyne, now a ruin; and a beautiful recumbent figure
recently placed in the Cathedral perpetuates his memory there. But as he advanced in
years, feeble in health, and long desirous of ending his days in a quiet retirement, he made
Oxford his choice, and wrote to the Secretary of State (in 1752) to ask leave to resign his
Bishopric. So unusual a desire as that of voluntary retirement, involving the loss of the
episcopal revenue, led the King, George II., to enquire who it was that preferred such
a request, and on learning that it was his old friend, Dr. Berkeley, declared that he should
die a Bishop in spite of himself, but might reside where he pleased. Before he left Ireland,
he instituted in his old College the two medals which bear his name for proficiency in
Greek. In Oxford he died, and was buried in the Cathedral of Christ Church. Markham,
the Archbishop of York, wrote his epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Si Christianus fueris</p>
<p class="verse2">Si amans patriæ</p>
<p class="verse0">Utroque nomine gloriari potes</p>
<p class="verse2">Berkleium vixisse.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Of the three portraits in our College perhaps none can be regarded as accurate. Probably
the somewhat idealised outlines of the Cloyne monument convey a true image of Berkeley
as his own generation knew him. “A handsome man,” it is said, “with a countenance full
of meaning and benignity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be out of place to attempt here to estimate Berkeley’s philosophical rank.
If Hamann’s verdict be just&mdash;“Without Berkeley no Hume, without Hume no Kant,” we
owe to the gentle wisdom of our great countryman a metaphysical debt difficult to overestimate;
but quite apart from the importance of his position in the evolution of the
critical idealism, the figure of that serene thinker, modest, tender, without reproach, will ever
win and hold the admiration and reverence of all lovers of the beautiful in life and character.</p>

<p>One of Berkeley’s most remarkable Episcopal brethren was Bishop Clayton, the mover
of a motion in the Irish House of Lords proposing that the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds
should be expunged from the Liturgy of the Church of Ireland&mdash;a somewhat bold proposal
on the part of a dignitary of the Church. Mention should also here be made of Philip
Skelton, a contemporary of Clayton, and a scholar of wide repute.</p>

<p>In 1744 two remarkable boys entered Trinity College, strangely unlike in disposition
and genius, both heirs of Fame, but destined to reach her temple by very different avenues.
Their names were Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith. The life of the tender-hearted,
vain, improvident, generous, altogether lovable author of the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite> and the
<cite>Deserted Village</cite>, with all its vicissitudes, its hours of extravagant luxury, and years
of hopeless poverty, is as well known to most children as are the works which his exquisite
art left the world for “a perpetual feast of nectared sweets.” There is nothing to tell of
him which has not been told and re-told, read and re-read, from the story of the young aspirant
for ordination presenting himself to his Bishop in a pair of scarlet breeches, to that simple
sentence of Johnson’s, when he heard of his death and his debts, “Let not his frailties be
remembered; he was a very great man.”</p>

<p>Goldsmith’s College career, like that of Swift, was not a brilliant one. Set him to
turn an ode of Horace into English verse, and you might count on a version that would
surprise the scholars; but give him a mathematical problem to solve, and he was a disgrace
to his University. It was the same until the end. The mathematics of life&mdash;the simple
additions and subtractions&mdash;were too much for him; but those marvellous versions of the
tales of his experience or imagination we still delight in and wonder at. The charm of that
delicate simplicity and ease of style has never been surpassed. Addison is justly honoured,
and as a writer of English generally appraised higher than Goldsmith; but I cannot think
that the Magdalen Scholar has a lightness of touch or a grace at all comparable to the poor
Sizar of Trinity. In Addison’s best essays a fastidious critic, while he admires their chastened
correctness, will observe a certain primness, an over-studied perfection of diction. Addison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
is a finished artist; but Goldsmith’s freedom gives greater pleasure, for he wrote under the
direct inspiration of Nature. Posterity, too, has given its inexorable decree in favour of the
Irishman. <cite>Cato</cite> is forgotten, but <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite> is with us still. The <cite>Spectator</cite> is
read in the study of the student of literature, but the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite> in every English
home. “To be the most beloved of English writers”&mdash;as Thackeray says&mdash;“what a title
that is for a man!”</p>

<p>The Earl of Mornington, whose more illustrious son, the great Duke, vanquished the
“World’s Victor” at Waterloo, was a contemporary of Goldsmith, and the first Professor
of Music in the University. Malone, the editor of Shakespeare, and Toplady, the hymn-writer,
graduated about the same time as the Earl, then a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filius nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>In connection with the name of Edmund Burke, some mention must be made of the
Historical Society, which claims him as its founder. Its splendid traditions date from the
inauguration of Burke’s Historical Club in 1747. Throughout its chequered career it has
preserved a peculiar pride and independence of spirit, intolerant of interference on the part
even of the authorities of the University, which not infrequently resulted in serious disagreement
affecting its existence inside the College walls, and on two occasions led to periods of
exile from the University, during which it found a home in the city. No other debating
society in the world, perhaps, can claim to rank with it as a cradle of orators. It has been
the palæstra of many of the most eloquent speakers of the English tongue. Besides its
founder Burke, Grattan and Curran, Plunket and Bushe, Sheil and Butt, and many another
master of rhetoric, practised at the debates of the “Historical” the art which has made
Ireland no less famous as mother of orators than she was formerly as mother of saints.
Throughout its career this Society has given to the Irish Bench and Bar their most
distinguished leaders, and many to England and the dependencies of the Crown. Three
of the members of the present Government were officers of the Society in their student
days; and the most recent loss it has sustained was by the death of William Connor Magee,
the late Archbishop of York, the first Auditor after its reconstitution in 1843.</p>

<p>The objects of the Club at its foundation, as appears from the minutes, were
“speaking, reading, writing, and arguing in Morality, History, Criticism, Politics, and all the
useful branches of Philosophy.” There are many points of interest in the earliest minute-book
of the Society, of which the greater part is in Burke’s handwriting. A critical
discrimination on the part of the members, remarkable in the light of later history, is
recorded in the minute of April 28, 1747, when “Mr. Burke, for an essay on the Genoese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
was given thanks for the matter, but not for the delivery.” The Club, consisting of a very
few members, grew in numbers until, at the period in which an Irish Parliament sat in
College Green, it was an assembly of six hundred, many of its prominent members being
also Members of Parliament. An ordinary excuse for the absence of a speaker from his
place seems to have been compulsory attendance in the Commons. The influence of such
a Society upon political opinion in Ireland was naturally considerable, and the expression of
the revolutionary views of many of its members, such as Emmet and Wolfe Tone, gave great
uneasiness to the Board of the College. It is only in comparatively recent years that the
feeling of suspicion with which the Society was regarded by the authorities has disappeared,
and it is far indeed from probable that occasion for it will ever again arise. There are few
pages of mere chronicle of names more potent in arousing patriotic enthusiasm in a lover
of Ireland, than those in the proceedings of this Society which are a record of its officers.</p>

<p>Although the oratory of Burke signally failed, on the great occasions upon which it
was displayed, to alter the determination or the policy of the majority of those to whom it
was addressed, he stands by general consent&mdash;to make no wider comparison&mdash;at the head of
the orators who spoke the English tongue. “Saturated with ideas” and magnificent in
diction as Burke’s oratory was, it is not as orator merely that he claims the attention of
students of history, nor as “our greatest English prose writer” (as Matthew Arnold calls
him) the attention of students of literature; the nobility of the man commands a deeper
admiration. “We who know Mr. Burke know that he will be one of the first men in the
country,” said Dr. Johnson, with that magnanimous appreciation of merit so characteristic of
him; and the estimate was not an exaggerated one. By far the most sagacious and
chivalrous statesman of his time, the high-minded disinterestedness and moral fervour of the
man, in an age such as that in which his lot was cast, give him a far-shining pre-eminence.
Again and again in his utterance rings the splendid note that stirs the blood as with the
sound of a trumpet&mdash;the note which only the brave man to whom belongs the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens conscia
recti</i> can dare to utter. Take this: “I know the map of England as well as the noble Lord
or any other person, and I know that the path that I take is not the way to preferment;”
or this, when a purblind electorate complained of his Parliamentary policy: “I do not here
stand before you accused of venality or of neglect of duty. It is not said that in the long
period of my service I have, in a single instance, sacrificed the slightest of your interests
to my ambition or to my fortune&mdash;No! the charges against me are all of one kind, that
I have pushed the principles of general justice and benevolence too far&mdash;further than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
cautious policy would warrant, and further than the opinions of many would go along with
me. In every accident which may happen through life&mdash;in pain, in sorrow, in depression
and distress&mdash;I will call to mind this accusation, and be comforted.” To read the speeches
of Burke is, I think, a liberal education in literature, in ethics, and in political philosophy.
No man can rise from a study of them uninstructed or unennobled.</p>

<p>To say that in his later years many of the finest qualities of his head and heart
failed him, is but to give trite expression to the familiar fact that man too has his “winter of
pale misfeature.” There is no figure in the history of English politics at once so great
and so noble as that of Edmund Burke.</p>

<p>As has been remarked, any record of the alumni of Trinity College must take note
of the remarkable grouping of the great names. The brilliant oratorical group belongs to
the period of the history of Ireland when her circumstances in a special sense called for
the public speaker, assigning to him patriotic duties and a noble theme. When Dublin
became the seat of a Parliament of real political power, it was the natural ambition of every
young Protestant Irishman of talent to make for himself a name and fame within its walls.
The responsibility of self-government brought in its train a national enthusiasm and zeal
which gave a new life to the country so long hopelessly misgoverned. For the first time
became possible in Ireland great public service in the cause of Ireland. In 1746 was born
Henry Grattan, the man destined by an ironical fate to gain by the splendour and force
of his advocacy an honourable independence for the legislature of his country, and to live
long enough to see the whole edifice, raised with so many fervent prayers and hopes, crumble
to pieces, undermined by the sustained effort of unexampled treachery and fraud in power.
In pathetic words Grattan described, when all was over, his relations to the Irish
Parliament&mdash;“I watched by its cradle; I followed it to the grave.”</p>

<div class="figleft">

<div class="caption">
EARL OF CLARE.</div>
</div>

<p>The story of the Irish orators of this fascinating epoch has been told by the most
judicial of living historians, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky, himself, like them, a son of the Dublin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mater Universitatis</i>. As he tells us, however divided political opinion in our day may
be over the vexed question of the government of this island, “the whole intellect of the
country” was bitterly opposed to the measure for a Union introduced by Lord Castlereagh.
The only man of ability and position in Ireland to whom it was not intolerable was
Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare. Sheridan, the champion of the Irish cause in the English
Parliament, could scarcely find words strong enough to express the intensity of his feelings.
“I would have fought for that Irish Parliament,” he said, “up to the knees in blood.” It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
may be difficult for the student of history to understand the fierceness of the opposition
with which Grattan, Flood, and Plunket met the proposal of the English Ministers, but in
the fire and force of their utterances a very sincere and determined spirit manifests itself.
The purity of their patriotism has never been questioned. Flood, the first of the Irish orators
who rose to prominence in the House, was described by Grattan as “the most easy and
best-tempered man in the world, as well as the most sensible.” Grattan, though fearless
in the open advocacy of his principles, was himself a man of modest and courteous
disposition. There was nothing of the political bully or blustering demagogue in the
champions of the cause of legislative independence.
While Grattan and Flood were devoting
all their energies to a common cause, they were
separated by a quarrel which no reconciliation
ever brought to an end. Standing apart from each
other, they nevertheless, with the native generosity
of the country which gave them birth, recognised
each the mental and moral worth of the other.
As speakers, Flood was admitted to be the more
convincing reasoner of the two; but Grattan,
rapid and epigrammatic, whose sentences were
always forged to a white heat, was irresistible.
His was “an oracular loftiness of words which
certainly came nearer the utterance of inspiration
than any eloquence, ancient or modern.” Both
were, in youth, unwearied students of the art
of which they became masters, and like Demosthenes also in this, that they thought
no pains too great to accomplish their ends, believing, like him, that pains so taken
were such as show “a kind of respect for the people.” Flood was a diligent pupil in the
school of classic oratory; while Grattan, no less persevering, in manner, in tone, in
everything that characterises a speaker, was peculiarly original and alone; for it cannot be
said that in any important particular he resembled any other great speaker. Comparing
him with other orators Mr. Lecky says&mdash;“It was left for Grattan to be profound while he
was fascinating, and pointed while he was profound.”</p>

<p>Although he had retired from public life, and was seriously ill when the measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
which resulted in legislative union with Great Britain was introduced, Grattan stood for a
vacant constituency, and re-entered the House whose independence he had gained while the
debate affecting its existence was in progress. There have been few more pathetic scenes
in the history of Parliaments than that which, in the final debate, shows us the old man
eloquent, too feeble to stand, and addressing the House by its leave seated, pleading for
the last time in the cause of his country. It was that he might spend his latest years in
support of the bill for the removal of the disabilities of Roman Catholics, whose
emancipation had been one of the objects of his political career, that Grattan consented to
enter the British Parliament. The keynote of his plea sounds in the words he used in one
of the speeches upon the question: “Bigotry may survive persecution, but it can never
survive toleration.” Like Edmund Burke, the path he chose in life was not one which led
to preferment; and it is best perhaps that his resting-place in the Abbey beside Pitt and
Fox is undistinguished by name or stone. What epitaph could England write for Henry
Grattan? The full-length portraits of Grattan and Flood possessed by the College hang
upon the same wall in the Dining Hall. That of Grattan represents him in the hour of
his triumph, moving the Declaration of Independence. Flood, a striking figure, stands
defiantly out, as if replying to a hostile speaker in the measured invective for which he
was famous. Flood’s name is to be found in the list of the benefactors of Trinity College.
He left an estate of five thousand pounds, to be devoted to the purchase of Irish MSS., and
for the encouragement of the study of that language.</p>

<p>In the minutes of the Irish Parliament, as moving and seconding motions for the
removal of the political disabilities of the Roman Catholics, appear frequently in combination
the names of two peers educated in Dublin University&mdash;Lords Mountjoy and O’Neill.
Parliamentary friends when the insurrection of Ninety-Eight plunged the country into civil
war, they became brothers in arms. Alike in fate, O’Neill fell at the battle of Antrim,
Mountjoy at New Ross.</p>

<p>Another illustrious Irish name among the Dublin graduates of the period is that of
Sir Lucius O’Brien, a leading statesman and financier in the Lower House, a man of much
practical ability and of unblemished honour. As leader of the “Country Party,” he was
foremost in the successful struggle to relieve Irish finance from waste and corruption, and
to free Irish trade and legislation from unjust restriction.</p>

<p>Plunket, by some considered Grattan’s equal as an orator, must be regarded as one
of the most remarkable men of his age. At the Bar, as in the Senate, he made a profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
impression upon men who, like Lord Brougham, his warm friend and admirer, were keen
critics and trained lawyers. The severity of his style distinguishes him from all other
speakers of the period. The grace and beauty of Plunket’s oratory are not to be found in
any wealth of ornamental diction. Its texture was logical; every phrase, whether direct or
involving illustration, was uttered with but one end in view&mdash;that of persuasion. To
dazzle without producing conviction is not a part of the aim of any sincere man. Plunket
made no effort to captivate the sense; he
addressed himself to the reason, and to
honourable victory.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>Curran, afterwards Master of the Rolls
under Fox during his short administration,
made his reputation as a speaker by his
defence of the prisoners in the trials of
Ninety-Eight. The speech&mdash;a masterpiece&mdash;in
which he defended Hamilton Rowan, was,
in the estimation of Brougham, “the most
eloquent speech ever delivered at the Bar.”
Curran’s eloquence is florid and passionate,
more typical of Irish oratory, as that phrase
is usually understood, than that of the
greater men of the time. He appealed
more directly to the emotions, and was a
consummate master in that difficult art&mdash;the arousing and controlling the feelings of his
audience. In this art his younger contemporary, Richard Lalor Sheil, also excelled.
Although of undignified figure, and denied by nature the gifts of voice and manner
which fascinate public assemblies, he overcame all obstacles to the attainment of that
power which, unlike that of the poet or philosopher, is always a witness of its own
triumph.</p>

<p>Thomas Moore was one of the first Roman Catholics to take advantage of the Act
of 1793, which threw open to them the University of Dublin. Although his co-religionists
now obtained the privilege of attending the College classes, they were debarred until many
years later from the higher academic honours, and Moore, who was entitled to a Scholarship
on his answering, could not profit by it. He was, however, recognised by the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
as a youth of promise, and was the recipient on one occasion of a special prize for a set
of English verses, the prize being a copy of the <cite>Travels of Anacharsis</cite>, with the inscription,
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Propter laudabilem in versibus componendis progressum</i>.” Moore’s recollections of the
debates in the Historical Society, of which he was a prominent member, are full of interest.
He became a close friend of Emmet, who was, he tells us, at this time “of the popular side
in the Society the chief champion and ornament.” In 1798, when Lord Clare, the Vice-Chancellor
of the University, held a solemn Visitation, with the view of discovering whether any
treasonable persons or factions had been at work among the students, Moore was examined
as a witness. At first he refused to take the oath, but, on learning that such refusal would
lead to expulsion, submitted, and gave his evidence, which disclaimed all knowledge of
any secret societies within the University. Moore acknowledges that the Visitation, though
somewhat of an arbitrary proceeding, was justified in its results. There were, he tells us, a
few, among them Robert Emmet, “whose total absence from the whole scene, as well as
the dead silence that day after day followed the calling out of their names, proclaimed
how deep had been their share in the unlawful proceedings inquired into by this tribunal.”
The modern critics of the psychological school seem to have agreed to place “Anacreon”
Moore far down on the roll of the “followers of the narrow footsteps of the bards.” They
are unable to find, in <cite>Lalla Rookh</cite> or the <cite>Irish Melodies</cite>, the intellectual mastery of life
without which poetry has for them no real value. They complain that in Moore the
sense of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“The heavy and the weary weight</p>
<p class="verse2">Of all this unintelligible world”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">is not sufficiently emphasised, and that he must therefore take rank as a poet of society
upon whom the eternal problems did not press heavily enough to make him a poet-philosopher.
The indictment may indeed be partially true; but there is poetry which has
as little of the character of a profound philosophy as have the cravings of the human heart.
“The Meeting of the Waters” or “She is far from the land,” though unweighted by any
profound or subtle thought, will outlive&mdash;to venture on prediction&mdash;the splendid unravelling
of intellectual complexities in “Mr. Sludge, the Medium.” There is not, I believe, to be
found in any literature more melodious utterance of real emotion than in the songs of this
true poetic brother of Oliver Goldsmith&mdash;like him, and unlike many of his contemporaries,
possessed of “the great poetic heart,” the possession of which, we have been told, is “more
than all poetic fame.” The charm, as I have already observed, of the greater part of the
poetry and prose of Ireland, lies in its unaffected purity and naturalness. The lyrical cry
we hear in the music-marvels&mdash;“I saw from the beach” and “Oft in the stilly night”&mdash;has
a piercing sweetness unrivalled by greater poets of vastly wider range. For the creator
of a nation’s songs there is little need to fear, despite the critics, the verdict, in a phrase
of Archer Butler’s, of “the incorruptible Areopagus of posterity.”</p>

<p>Yet other members of the Historical Society were found among the leaders of the
revolutionary party in the troublous times of the Irish Rebellion. Wolfe Tone, the leader of
the United Irishmen, had sat in the chair of the Society, obtained three of its medals, and
delivered the closing address of one of the sessions. His place in history has been
accurately defined by a brilliant young Irish University man of the present generation,
Mr. T. W. Rolleston: “He found national sentiment the property of a small aristocratic
section; he left it the dominant sentiment of the millions of the Irish democracy.”</p>

<p>The author of “A Battle of Freedom,” Thomas Davis, may rightly be called the
Tyrtæus of the national party. He too held the premier office, that of Auditor, in the
Society above mentioned, and might, had he lived, have reached a high place, not only
among Irish but among English poets.</p>

<p>Dublin claims many other names of literary note&mdash;Sir Samuel Ferguson, recently
lost to us, whose themes were the ancient traditions and legends of his native land; and
(to go a generation further back) that poet who has earned the laurel by adding to the
treasury of literature one poem not to be forgotten&mdash;“The Burial of Sir John Moore.”
(<em>See fac-simile</em>, <a href="#Page_260">pp. 260, 261</a>.)</p>

<p>It is not part of my task to write contemporary history, of the Senate or the Bar,
in the careers of Butt or Napier or Whiteside or Cairns. With students of philosophy
Archer Butler is a name to be reverenced, and Stokes and Graves gave to the School of
Medicine in Dublin a European reputation, as witness such a passage as this from
Professor Trousseau: “As Clinical Professor in the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, I have
incessantly read and re-read the work of Graves; I have become inspired with it in my
teaching; I have endeavoured to imitate it in the book I have myself published on
the Clinique of the Hotel-Dieu; and even now, though I know almost by heart all that
the Dublin Professor has written, I cannot refrain from perusing a book which never leaves
my study.” In theology, Magee&mdash;Archbishop of Dublin, O’Brien, Lee, and Fitzgerald,
and in Irish antiquarian research Todd and Reeves, have made for themselves an abiding
reputation.</p>

<p>Mathematicians will not need to be reminded of the
importance of the work done in their province by Hamilton
and MacCullagh. Sir William Rowan Hamilton ranks with
the greatest of the explorers of new scientific territory. To
name the author of the <cite>General Method in Dynamics</cite> and
the inventor of the method of Quaternions is sufficient; it is
impossible here to do more. The position held by Trinity
College in this century as a seat of mathematical learning is
largely due to MacCullagh. He it was who introduced here
a more comprehensive study of the work of Continental
mathematicians, under the auspices of Provost Lloyd.</p>

LEVER.</div>
</div>

<p>The Irish novelists, Maxwell and Le Fanu, have been
overshadowed by the greater Lever. Lever’s descriptions of College life in <cite>Charles O’Malley</cite>
and other of his novels are a faithful reproduction of his own experiences. Take him all
in all, he is one of the best story-tellers we
have had or shall ever have; a romancer
who holds his readers breathless till the
last page is turned in his stories of adventure,
and a dramatist whose situations are
among the most powerful in fiction. The
underlying melancholy which Thackeray saw
in Lever gives to his later books, from which
the high boyish spirits of the earlier tales
are absent, a graver and deeper human
interest. But he is the most cheerful companion
of all the great story-tellers; and
who does not feel a relief in taking up
Lever after the motive-grinding and mental
dissections of the modern novel of purpose?</p>

<p>With the last mentioned name I shall
close this review, for I must not enter the
world of to-day. The careers which we
or our fathers have watched in person have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
been too lately followed to be spoken of here. They must read many books who seek to
know the fortunes and achievements of the graduates of Dublin in recent years, for a
record of them will carry the reader into the political, military, and literary history of the
English-speaking peoples in all the continents.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE COLLEGE PLATE.</span></h2>

<p class="p1" />
<div><img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_281b.jpg" width="100" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">The earliest mention of any acquisition of Plate seems to be the list of
subscriptions (in 1600) for the College Mace, which cost £12, a large sum
in those days. I have heard Provost Humphrey Lloyd say that this ancient
relic of the first days of the College was extant in his time, and sometimes
used, but, being in the charge of the Bedell, disappeared when the larger and
handsomer mace, now still in use, came to be habitually produced. This
regrettable loss dates from that period in the history of the College when all
ancient things were neglected.</p>

<p>The next entry in the Registry seems to occur in the negotiations concerning
a lease with John Richardson, Bishop of Ardagh, a friend of James Ussher. In addition to
his rent, he promised to give Communion Plate to the value of £30&mdash;“a chalice, paten,
and stoup of silver.” This precious gift (<em>cf.</em> <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>) is still in use, having escaped all
the violences, the negligences, the ignorances of many generations. The set contains more
articles than those given by Richardson, some far later in date (1700, 1764, &amp;c.), but all
imitated from his gift as a model. The chalice bears the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs80" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
“1632. Johs. Richardson, S.T.P., hujus Collegii quondum socius,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Esse sui dedit hoc monumentum et pignus amoris.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The flagons are of the finest Caroline design, perfectly simple, with slight <em>entasis</em> like a
Greek pillar. One of them (of the year 1638) bears the inscription&mdash;</p>

SALVER&mdash;GILBERT, 1734.</div>
</div>

<p>It is remarkable that the two silver-gilt chalices now in use at S. Canice’s Cathedral,
Kilkenny, are exactly the same in design, and dated (from the hall mark) 1635. They have
been recently regilt, while ours has the gilding worn almost completely away. That this
gift was not the first, or a solitary
act, is proved by the note in a letter
of Lord Cork, dated May, 1630: “I
give my chaplain 50s. to pay the
ffees to the officers of Trynitie
Colledge, near Dublin, for the admittance
of my two sons, Lewis and
Hodge, into that house, and must
also present plate.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It would seem,
therefore, that such gifts were still
merely voluntary, whereas at some
very early date the practice was
adopted of taxing each student at
matriculation for <em>argent</em>. In an
account of the year 1628 occurs,
“From Mr. Floyd, in lieu of two
pieces plate to be bestowed on the
College, £4.” If this was a matriculating
Fellow Commoner, we can see that the custom was just then passing, like other
“Benevolences” known in history, from being purely voluntary into the class of duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>But of all these early gifts, only the Communion Plate survives. What became of
the rest appears from the following record (from the days of the great Irish Rebellion), which
I quote from Dr. Stubbs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In] the College [there] had accumulated a considerable amount of valuable plate, which had been
presented to it from time to time by noblemen and wealthy commoners, whose sons had entered as
students. In one of the early books there is an inventory of the plate, “8 Potts; 14 Goblets;
2 Beakers, 9 Bowles; 3 Standing Pieces”; and the names of the donors are preserved.</p>

<p>In the Bursar’s books we find the following entries:&mdash;</p></div>

<p>The whole exceeds £500, then a very large sum. Yet there must have been much more
besides, for it seems impossible that in the subsequent thirty years 5,000 ounces had again
accumulated. It is not likely that Winter and his associates encouraged such donations, and
we may assume that they commenced again with the Restoration. There remain from the
Restoration time only two relics, both of which escaped the wreck to be presently related
as being consecrated to the service of the Chapel, viz., a very handsome alms-plate (15·7),
in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">repoussé</span> work (hall mark A.R., with a figure under them, enclosed in a heart-shaped oval),
given by Nehemiah Donelan in 1666; and a far larger (31·05), perfectly plain alms-plate, of
great simplicity and beauty, given by Richard Bellingham in 1669. There are four later
copies (1746, 1814?) of this plate in the set now used in the Chapel.</p>

<p>We now come to the disastrous days of James II. I again quote from Dr. Stubbs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Provost and Senior Fellows considered that at this time materials for buildings are cheap, and that workmen
may be hired at easy rates, have agreed on to finish the buildings, where the foundation is laid on the south side of the
Great Court, and to that end they have resolved to ask leave of the Visitors of the College to sell so much of the plate
as will be sufficient to defray the charge of the said buildings.”</p>
</div>

<p>A memorial was presented to the Visitors, and their answer was received by the 24th January,
permitting the sale of the plate for the purpose of either building or of purchasing land. On the
26th of January a petition was presented to the Earl of Clarendon, then Lord Lieutenant, asking
permission to sell the plate in London, instead of in Dublin, “since exchange runs so high at
present.” On the 29th of January the Lord Lieutenant granted leave to the College to transport into
England 5000 ounces of wrought plate, duty free. On the 7th of February 3999 ounces of plate were
shipped on board the “Rose” of Chester, consigned to Mr. Hussey, a merchant of London, who was
directed to insure a considerable portion of it. On the 12th of February Lord Tyrconnell was sworn
into office as successor to the Earl of Clarendon; and on the 14th he gave directions to have the
College plate seized on board ship; and it was brought on shore, and lodged in the Custom
House by order of the Lord Deputy. Whereupon the College made application to have the property
belonging to the Body given back to it; to which the Lord Deputy’s reply was, that he had written
to the King concerning it, and that he had no doubt they should have it ultimately restored to them.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April the plate was restored to the College on a promise
that they would “no otherwise employ it but for the public use, benefit, and
improvement of the College, nor transport it from Ireland without the permission
of the authorities;” and on the 7th it was brought from the Custom House, and
deposited for safe keeping “in a closet in the Provost’s lodging;” and the Board at
once decided that the produce of the plate should be laid out in the purchase of
land, and that such purchase should be inquired after.</p>

<p>On the 8th of June an offer was made by Mr. John Sandes, in the Queen’s
County, to sell land in that county (the estate now called Monaquid and Cappeneary),
to the College for £1150. On the 5th of July the Board offered to Mr. Sandes to
pay him £1000 in money from the sale of the College plate, and to give him a
twenty-one years’ lease of the lands at £80 a-year. If he refused, the Board
decided to offer Sir George St. George eight years’ purchase for his land in the
county of Kilkenny. On the 21st of November the plate was ordered to be sold
to Mr. Benjamin Burton, at 5<em>s.</em> per ounce, to purchase Monaquid from John Sandes.
On the first day of April following Burton purchased 3960½ ounces, for which he
gave his bond to pay £990 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> On the 7th of February,
168<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">7</span>
  <span class="blka over">8</span>
</span>, the Lord
Deputy sent for the Provost about the sale of the plate by the College, which he
said was “against his command, and their former obligations.” The Provost told
him that it was to purchase £80 a-year for the College. The Lord Deputy said
that “he did not know but £80 a-year might be as good for the College as the
plate,” but he directed them to hold their hands until he had consulted the
Attorney-General (Nagle).</p>

<p>It is clear that Nugent, having now become Chief Justice, was a bitter enemy
of the College, and at the bottom of all this trouble, for we find that he took upon
himself to send for Mr. Burton, and to examine him as to the purchase of the plate.
Burton admitted that he had done so, and the Chief Justice charged him with having
bought stolen plate which belonged to the King, and bound him over to prosecute
the Provost and Senior Fellows at the next Term.</p>

<p>The Provost afterwards consulted the Attorney-General, who, upon hearing
the whole matter, approved of the design of the College to buy land with the
proceeds of the plate, and promised to give a true representation of the affair to
his Excellency. On the 17th February the Lord Deputy told the Provost that he
had discoursed with the Lord Chancellor and some of the Judges about it, and
thought that matter might be accommodated. He bid the Provost to beware of
the title of the land, and to consult the Attorney-General, which the College afterwards
did; and Nagle gave his advice and assistance in the drawing up of the deeds
relating to the purchase of the land; and on the 12th of April, 1688, the purchase
of Mr. Sandes’ estate was completed at £1150, the balance of the plate money
being paid out of the common chest.</p>

<p>The terrible risks to which the old Communion Plate was presently exposed have
been mentioned (<em>cf.</em> <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) in a former chapter.</p>

<p>From the period of the 2nd Restoration, a great series of gifts commences with the
salver given by Provost Huntingdon, which is stated to be worth £30. This estimate is far
above the value, and can never have been paid for it. I think it not unlikely that it was
the very piece given by the College to him, in testimony of his kindness to the exiled
members of the College in 1690. He was afterwards, by their influence, made Bishop
of Raphoe, but died in a few days after his consecration. This present may have been
bequeathed back again to the College.</p>

<p>With the increase of prosperity, after William III. had conquered at the Boyne, we find
the habit arising of presenting forks, spoons, and other plate for ordinary table use, by Fellow
Commoners. There is a considerable stock of this kind, now hidden in the College safes,
dated from 1693 to 1705, and some of it a good deal later; and with these simpler articles
are eighteen silver candlesticks of very good design, all of Queen Anne’s period. The finest
and largest were given for the use of the altar by Pierce Butler, the 4th Viscount
Ikerron (now the 2nd title of the Earl of Carrick) in 1693. Of nearly the same period
are a number of handsome salvers and cups, fluted, as Irish silver so often was at that
period, ranging from 1690 to 1708. The handsomest cups are those given by Archbishop
Palliser and Mr. Duncombe, of Cork, respectively, which are reproduced on <a href="#Page_272">p. 273</a>. The best
of the salvers are a pair given by the Marquis of Abercorn, at the entrance of his elder two
and his younger two sons, whose arms and names are engraved upon the centre. An
epergne of George II.’s time is given on <a href="#Page_274">p. 274</a>. But the number of these beautiful gifts,
and their variety, is such that it would require a volume to reproduce them, and a specialist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
to describe them. Of the cups we have given several specimens on <a href="#Page_267">p. 267</a>. The punch-bowls,
and the beautiful ladles made for them subsequently (1746), are not easily to be surpassed.
But on a par with them may be placed the College mace (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_271">p. 271</a>), with the hall mark of
1707, of which there is no mention made, unless it be in the College Register. The gilt
silver salver from the bequest of Claud. Gilbert in 1734 (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_268">p. 268</a>) is the last great addition
to the Communion Plate. What was since made or given is mere copying of the old models.</p>

<p>We should have imagined that these are only a few specimens of the large gifts now
received by the College from its increasing classes, and from the increase in the wealth of
its members; yet we hear the following curious story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Mornington, for Plate, £659 11s. 7d.”
Whether this sum represents the price of the plate
purchased from him by the College, or that which
he was authorised to expend for the College, we
cannot say. In eight years from 1758, a sum of
close upon £1250 was expended in purchases of
this description. No doubt the College had at
this period many large cups presented to it from
time to time, but in respect to ordinary table
silver it appears to have been in Provost Baldwin’s
time very deficient. When the Lord Lieutenant
was entertained by the College, plate had to be
hired of the silversmiths for the occasion; but
as each Fellow-Commoner had been for a long
period charged £6 at his entrance for plate, and
each Pensioner 12s., a very considerable sum must
have accumulated which was applicable for this
purpose.</p></div>

<p>Looking carefully into the plate chests
to see how this large sum of money was spent, we only find a number of large dishes for
turbot, joints of meat, &amp;c., and their covers, all of solid silver, together with side cover
dishes, and thirty-three open dishes of various sizes, which can account for it. The supply
of knives and forks, which is large, all comes from special and named bequests. The designs
are not very good, and the plate of a kind not easy to use now-a-days.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> When the next
misfortune happened to the College Plate, it is a pity that the large and now useless dishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had not gone out of fashion. Provost Hutchinson, desiring to have a set of plates to
match the dishes, got leave to melt down old cups and pots to make the set which we
still possess, and which are really handsome (<em>circ.</em> 1780). A MS. is preserved among
the College documents specifying the cups so destroyed, as well as the coats of arms
upon them. They mostly dated from the reign of George I., and were in many cases
one of a pair given by the same donor, of which the second still survives. But with
this act of his Provostship, long before the close of the century, all public spirit in the
matter seems suddenly quenched. The tax for <em>argent</em> had been abandoned, we know not
when. Provost Murray and his successors had no taste for display, still less for adding
material dignity to the College, and it has been left for our own generation to re-discover
the beauty and the value of this series of ancient gifts, which for three generations were only
seen at dinners in the Provost’s House. The feelings of generous young men were probably
damped by seeing that what their predecessors had given <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in usum Collegii</i> had disappeared
from sight, and was lost out of mind. Possibly the tutors may have fanned the indignation
of their pupils at the appropriation of the gifts intended for the College Hall by the
Provost for the adornment of his country seat. The Fellow Commoners could no longer
obtain plate for their breakfasts or luncheons, as the students of Oxford or Cambridge
Colleges did, and still do. With the return of greater respect for these bequests will return
again to the members of the College the desire to leave this very tasteful record of
gratitude for the daily contemplation and use of succeeding generations.</p>

<span class="fs60">THE BOTANICAL GARDENS AND HERBARIUM.</span></h2>

<p class="pfs80">“<em>The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns.</em>”</p>

<p class="p1" />
<div><img class="drop-capx" src="images/i_289b.jpg" width="100" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-capx">In the year 1711 there was a Lecturership of Botany in connection with the
Medical School of Trinity College, and there was apparently a “Physic
Garden” near the School, extending from the Anatomy House towards Nassau
Street, as seen on Rocque’s Map (<em>ante</em>, <a href="#Page_186">p. 187</a>). Dr. Nicholson was the first
Lecturer; he published a pamphlet of some 40 pages, entitled <cite>Methodus plantarum,
in horto medico collegii Dublinensis, jamjam disponendarum</cite>, Dublini, 1712,
which the writer has not seen. The garden could not have been on a very large
scale, but it would appear to have supplied the needs of the School for over
fifty years, for it is not until during the Lecturership of Edward Hill that we find that the
garden was transferred to the neighbourhood of Harold’s Cross, where it was in part the
private property of the Lecturer on Botany, but assisted by a grant in aid from the College.
Dr. Stubbs<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> tells us that “in 1801 a Curator was appointed, and that in March, 1805, his salary
was fixed at £130 yearly, out of which he was to employ two labourers all the year round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and two additional labourers from March to December.” Mr. Hill retired from the Lecturership
in 1800, which, on the passing of the Act 25 George III. (1785), “for establishing a complete
School of Physic in Ireland,” had been made into a University Professorship. There was
some difference of opinion between Hill and the College authorities as to the value of the
plants and houses, and in the College accounts for 1803 there occurs the following entry:&mdash;“Dr.
Hill, allowed him by the award of the arbitrators, to whom the cause between the
College and him concerning the Botany Garden was referred, £618 19s. 8d.”</p>

<p>The two last decades of the last century were noteworthy, from a botanical point of
view, for the immense interest that was taken in Great Britain and Ireland about the
cultivation of exotic plants; the latter voyages of Captain Cook, and those of Captain
Vancouver, had, through the zeal of Banks, Solander, and Menzies&mdash;to mention only a trio
of the worthies of that period&mdash;been the means of bringing to the Kew Gardens many most
interesting plants; the publication by Aiton of his <cite>Hortus Kewensis</cite>, a catalogue of the
plants cultivated in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and of Francis Bauer’s <cite>Delineations
of Exotic Plants</cite> cultivated in the same gardens, had given a fresh impetus to their study,
and from about this date the period of the scientific Botanic Garden may be said to date,
and the day of the “Physic Garden” to end.</p>

<p>The subject of having a Botanical Garden in Dublin began to be debated about
1789, and in 1790 the Irish House of Commons voted a sum of £300 to the Dublin
Society “in aid of the cost of providing a Botanic Garden;” this Society, which took an
active interest in everything tending to promote the welfare of the country, at once appointed
a Committee, consisting of Drs. Perceval, Hill, and Wade, to consider the question. Dr.
Perceval had just retired from the Secretaryship of the Royal Irish Academy. Dr. Hill
was the Dublin University Professor of Botany. Dr. Wade was the Lecturer on Botany
to the Dublin Society, and the author of the first published catalogue of Dublin plants, and
of <cite>Plantæ rariores in Hibernia inventæ</cite>. On the report of this Committee, the Royal
Dublin Society resolved that letters should be written to the University of Dublin and the
College of Physicians requesting their advice and assistance, and hoping that they would
approve of the measure and have money granted towards the scheme. This letter was sent
in June, 1791, and after the long vacation the Board of Trinity replied through their
Registrar as follows:&mdash;“That it had been of a long time the anxious wish of the Board
of Trinity College to co-operate in any scheme by which a Botanic Garden may be
established on the most useful principles; that for this purpose they had allocated an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
annual sum at present exceeding £100, and in order to expedite the plan they had
appointed a Select Committee of the Senior Fellows, who were ready at the most
convenient time to meet any deputation from the Dublin Society and the College of
Physicians, and to report their proceedings to the Board.” At this time the College of
Physicians had not replied to the invitation of the Dublin Society; but on December
8th, 1791, they also intimated that they had appointed a Select Committee, consisting of
Sir W. G. Newcomen, Bart., Andrew Caldwell, and Patrick Bride, to consider the subject.</p>

<p>What negotiations may have taken place during 1792 are not known, but we find
that in 1793 a Bill was brought in to the House of Commons, by the Right Hon. the
Secretary of State, “to direct the application of certain sums of money heretofore granted
towards providing and maintaining a Botanic Garden to the Dublin Society, and for the
appointment of Trustees for that purpose;” whereupon the Provost and Board of Senior
Fellows presented the following petition:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“MARTIS, 11 DIE JUNII, 1793.</p>

<p>“A petition of the Provost, Fellows, and Scholars of the College, under their common seal,
was presented to the House and read, setting forth, that the Petitioners and their predecessors have
for a long series of years used their best endeavours to promote the study and improve the faculty of
Physic in said College, and considerable sums of money have been, and are annually and otherwise
applied by them for that purpose.</p>

<p>“That an Act having passed in this kingdom for the establishment of a complete School of
Physic, of which the University Professors make a part, namely, the Professors of Botany, Chemistry,
and Anatomy, the petitioners, for the encouragement of science, and without obligation from the
charter or statutes so to do, have continued to make a liberal provision for the support of those
professorships; that a Botanic Garden is indispensably necessary for the success of that science, but
the funds of said College are totally inadequate to the establishment or support of such an institution,
they have exerted their utmost efforts to promote it by allocating for that purpose a fund, which in
the last year amounted to £112, but which will be insufficient for the establishment or maintenance
of such an institution; that the Legislature having been pleased to grant several sums of money to
the Dublin Society towards providing and maintaining a Botanic Garden, that society caused application
to be made to the petitioners for their advice, assistance, and contributions, and, as the petitioners are
informed, applied to the College of Physicians for the like purposes, and the members of the College
have, as far as in them lay, granted the annual sum of £100 for the purpose out of funds vested in
them for medical purposes; the petitioners apprehend that by the application of the said several funds,
and by the co-operation of a certain number of persons out of the said three bodies, the success of
said scheme will be most effectually promoted; that the copy of a bill for these purposes having been
laid before the petitioners, they are humbly of opinion that the said bill, if passed into a law, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
tend to promote the success of the said institution, which they consider as necessary to a complete
School of Physic, and useful to the University, and whatever regulations may be made in respect to
the said establishment, they humbly hope that the wisdom of the Legislature will provide that medical
and other students shall have the full benefit of it, the petitioners having nothing in view but their
advantage, the success of said School of Physic, and the advancement of science.</p>

<p>“Ordered, that the said petition be referred to the committee of the whole House, to whom it
was referred to take into consideration a Bill for directing the application of certain sums of money
heretofore granted towards providing and maintaining a Botanic Garden, and for the appointment of
trustees for that purpose.”[173]</p>
</div>

<p>A petition from the President and Fellows of the King’s and Queen’s College of
Physicians in Dublin, under the common seal, was presented to the House and read, setting
forth&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That in the year 1758 the House was pleased to appoint a committee to inquire into the
best means for the establishment of a complete School of Physic in this kingdom, and to refer a petition
from the petitioners for that purpose to the said committee, before which several of said College were
examined, who, on such examination, declared their opinion that a Botanic Garden was necessary to
such an institution; and the said committee was pleased to enter into a resolution to that effect: that
in the year 1790 the Legislature was pleased to grant to the Dublin Society, towards providing and
maintaining a Botanic Garden, and the said society, &amp;c.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It then proceeds in a manner similar to the petition from the College, and it was
ordered for consideration with it. With what immediate result is not apparent; but on the
20th of June in the next year (1794) the Dublin Society petitioned the Irish House of
Commons that “they might have the sole management of the sums granted by Parliament
for the purposes of a Botanic Garden, and that such sums may not be invested in trustees
contrary to the grant already made to it, and further, that no other body may be joined with
said society in the execution of the trusts reposed in it.”</p>

<p>The influence of the Society proved to be stronger in the House of Commons than
that of the University of Dublin or the College of Physicians, and the Dublin Society
was intrusted with the sole management of the sums voted, and so the conjoint scheme
ended. The Dublin Society, in February, 1792, had appointed a Committee, consisting of
the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Bishop of Kilmore, Sir W. G. Newcomen,
S. Hayes, Th. Burgh, And. Caldwell, and Col. C. Eustace, with powers to take ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
for a Botanical Garden for the Society; and on the decision of the House of Commons
being known, the Society, on the 26th February, 1795, took possession of sixteen acres
of ground near the “town of Glasnevin, which Major Tickell held by a Toties Quoties
Lease from the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church.”</p>

<p>In July, 1806, the Board of Trinity College took a lease of a small piece of ground
near Ball’s Bridge, about a mile from the College, containing over three acres; in 1832
they acquired about two acres adjoining in addition, alongside the Pembroke Road. In
1848 about two acres more as a shelter belt along the Lansdowne Road were added, so that
the garden now consists of something more than eight acres in all. The first-mentioned plot
was surrounded by a high wall, and in 1807 the laying out of the ground was commenced
by the newly-appointed Curator, J. T. Mackay. Some twenty years after, we find Mackay
writing as follows about “several foreign plants naturalised under the climate of Ireland,
chiefly in these gardens”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The College Botanic Garden, which was established in 1807, is situated on the Black Rock road
about half-a-mile from Dublin. The soil is a deep sandy loam.</p>

<p>“It may be necessary to remark in order the degree of cold the plants were subjected to. Although
the winters in Ireland are in general very mild, the intensity of the frost during the last five winters has
been occasionally very great, as in December, 1819, the thermometer once fell to 15° Fahr.; in January,
1820, to 16° Fahr.; in February, 1821, to 16° Fahr.; in December, 1822, to 25° Fahr.; in January, 1823, to
15° Fahr.; and on December 3, 1824, to 18° Fahr.”</p>

<p>He gives a list of thirty-seven plants, chiefly natives of Chili, China, New South Wales, and the
South of Europe, planted in the open air, and among them “<em>Veronica decussata</em>, a native of the Falkland
Islands, the only shrubby species of the genus. <em>Olea europea</em>, which was unprotected for the last seven
years. <em>Ligustrum lucidum</em>: one plant in the open border was now six feet high [it is now twenty feet].
<em>Pittosporum tobira</em>, lately introduced, stood without protection. <em>Solanum bonariense</em> stood planted near a wall.
<em>Cassia stipulacea</em> stood out by a wall, in a south-east exposure, for the last eight years, and produced copiously
its showy blossoms in April and May, but required some mat protection in severe weather. <em>Aristotelia
Macqui</em>: one specimen is now fourteen feet high; it retains its leaves in mild winters, but drops them in
spring before another set is produced. <em>Mespilus japonica</em> (Loquat) grows to a large size, retains its leaves
throughout the winter, but never flowers; and <em>Melaleuca alba</em> stood out on a south-east wall for the last
five years, and blossomed last summer.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>
</div>

<p>James Townsend Mackay was the author of the <cite>Flora Hibernica</cite>, published in
Dublin in 1836. He was made an honorary LL.D. of the University of Dublin in
1849. He was an excellent botanist, and his name is still kept in grateful and pleasant
memory in the Gardens which he laid out, and which he so ably managed for over forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
years. Harvey named after him a beautiful acanthaceous plant, <em>Mackaya bella</em>. On his
decease Mr. John Bain was appointed Curator, and on his retirement on an annuity Mr.
Frederick Moore was appointed, on whose succeeding his well-known father, Dr. David
Moore, in the care of the Botanical Gardens, Glasnevin, the post was given to F. W.
Burbidge, M.A.&mdash;about all of whom, as happily still living, we cannot write.</p>

<p>The outer garden, which runs along two sides of the ground originally enclosed, is
surrounded by a lofty iron railing. This space has been most judiciously planted with trees
and shrubs. Hollies in variety are especially luxuriant. Advantage has also been taken of
the wall, which is now covered with many choice plants, among which may be mentioned
fine plants of <em>Magnolia grandiflora</em>, which in some years flower profusely; <em>Colletia ferox</em>
and <em>C. cruciata</em>, large specimens of <em>Pyrus japonica</em>, <em>Wistaria sinensis</em>, <em>Chimonanthus fragans</em>,
<em>Choisya ternata</em>, <em>Smilax latifolia</em>, and many such like.</p>

<p>The inner garden contains a well-arranged collection of the principal natural orders
of plants, a large stove-house, two green-houses, an orchid and a fern house. Opposite
one of the green-houses there is a small pond, the water for which is brought in from
the River Dodder; but, in addition to this water-supply, the garden has a supply under
pressure from the City of Dublin Water Works.</p>

<p>The Gardens are open during daylight to the officers and students of the College,
and to others on orders to be obtained from any of the Fellows or the Professor of
Botany. Lectures are delivered in the Gardens during Trinity Term to the Medical
School Class, and to students working for the Natural Science Medal.</p>

<h3 class="no-brk">THE HERBARIUM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Between 1830 and 1840 there was a small collection of plants kept in presses in No. 40
College, which chiefly consisted of a series of specimens gathered in Mexico and California
by Dr. Coulter; but it was not until 1844, when the late Dr. W. H. Harvey was appointed
Curator, while Dr. G. J. Allman was elected to the Professorship of Botany, that the
foundation of the present Herbarium was really laid. Dr. Harvey, prior to 1841, had spent
several years in an official position at the Cape of Good Hope, where he had succeeded in
making large collections of the native plants, and he had from time to time published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a><br /><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
(chiefly in Hooker’s <cite>Journal of Botany</cite>) many descriptions of new and rare forms. Compelled
by the state of his health to return to Europe in the spring of 1842, in the following year
his health was sufficiently restored to make him wish for some active employment. The
Professorship of Botany became vacant in 1843, and Harvey was a candidate. To qualify him
for the post, Harvey was made a M.D. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Honoris Causa</i>; but it was contended that this was
not sufficient, and that a properly qualified medical man alone could occupy the chair. As
a result, Allman was elected to the Professorship, and the post of Curator of the Herbarium
was specially endowed for Harvey, who presented his collection of dried plants to the College,
and received some increased pay therefor, with a proviso that, should other provisions be
made, and that as a result he were to lose the post, a certain sum that was agreed upon
should be paid to Harvey by the College. He entered upon his duties in March, 1844, and
for a little over twenty years the Herbarium was yearly increased by his zeal and labour.
In September, 1844, we find a record of his adding 4,000 species at “one haul” to the
collection, from Sir W. Hooker’s duplicates; a few weeks later were added 1,400 species
from the interior of the Swan River Colony, collected by Drummond. Soon the couple of
rooms in No. 40 became too small, and room after room was added until the whole of the
first or floor flat was filled. With this increase of specimens came the necessary demands
on the Bursar for money, not only to pay for new plants, but for the necessary paper on
which to mount them. At first an annual sum of £10 was placed at Harvey’s disposal; then
on his urgent entreaties, supported by those of John Ball, who from the first days of the
Herbarium to the last of his own was ever a faithful friend of Trinity College, this sum was
increased to £30 (this to include the ten). Next we find serious objection taken to a special
charge of £34 for paper, and Harvey was obliged to promise that he would be content if
allowed to spend an average annual sum of £10 on this most important adjunct to a
Herbarium.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_295.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
BOTANICAL GARDENS&mdash;THE POND. WINTER.</div>
</div>

<p>In spite of all these little drawbacks, by the year 1850 the Board’s confidence in
Harvey had so increased, and the Bursar had become so sympathetic, that we find a
yearly sum of £108 paid as Herbarium expenses, and collections were bought from Spruce,
Bowker, Wright, Fendler, Jameson, and many others.</p>

<p>The year 1858 was rendered notable by the purchase of Count Limingan’s Herbarium
for £237, the duplicates of which were disposed of to the Melbourne University Herbarium
and to the Queen’s College, Cork. During 1849-50 Harvey visited the United States, and
by this visit greatly added to the College collections; and his lengthened tour in Australia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and the South Sea Islands during 1853-55, chiefly made for the purpose of collecting <em>Algæ</em>,
resulted in making the College Herbarium so rich in these forms that it has become a
necessary resort for all students of this group of plants, containing as it does the types as
well as the finest series of specimens collected by one who was during his lifetime the chief
authority upon these plants. Harvey died on the 15th of May, 1866, at Torquay. To the
very last the College Herbarium was in his thoughts. To the writer of these lines he
dictated a letter, signed by him in pencil, and dated the 12th May, 1866, giving directions
about certain packages of plants:&mdash;“The six bundles of <em>Erica</em> belong to the Cape Government
Herbarium, and should be put with the others in the box, so that they may not be forgotten
when the packing time comes. On the table you will find in an old marble paper cover
the MSS. of the new edition of the <cite>Genera of South African Plants</cite>, which put by carefully,
and which Dr. Hooker will probably inquire about;” and so on with four pages of last
words, for the letter concludes, “I tell you all these things because I never expect to see
the Herbarium again, and I wish to leave all things as straight as I can.”</p>

<p>In 1878 the Herbarium was transferred from No. 40 College, these rooms being
required for students, to the large room over the great staircase leading to the Front or
Regent’s Hall; but since then, as no money is allowed for the purchase of new specimens,
the increase of the collection has depended exclusively on donations, and some very generous
ones have been received, among which may be mentioned as among the more important
those from Dr. Grunow, of Vienna; Professor Farlow, of the Harvard University; Dr. E.
Bornet, of Paris; Professor A. G. Agardh, of Upsala; and Baron F. Mueller, of Melbourne.</p>

<p>The general collection in the Herbarium is a fairly representative one. There is still
kept as a distinct collection the one made by Harvey for the purpose of writing the <cite>Flora
Capensis</cite>. The British Collection is also kept by itself. There is a very fine series of
<em>algæ</em> and of mosses, and a small collection of lichens and fungi. A commencement has
been made of a collection of woods, fruits, and seeds in the Botanical Museum.</p>

<p>Every fourth year the members elected by one of the <em>Classis</em> retire. The election for four representatives of the
<em>Classis Secunda</em> will take place on the 28th October, 1892.</p>

<p>The Council nominate to all Professorships, except those the nomination of which is vested in some other body or
persons by Act of Parliament, or by the directions of private founders, and except also the following Professorships in
the School of Divinity; that is to say, the Regius Professorship of Divinity, Archbishop King’s Lecturership in Divinity,
and the Professorship of Biblical Greek. Such nominations shall be subject to the approval of the Provost and Senior
Fellows.</p>

<p>In the event of the said Provost and Senior Fellows refusing their approval to the nomination of the Council,
the Chancellor shall decide whether the grounds for such refusal are sufficient. If they shall appear to him to be
insufficient, he shall declare the person nominated by the Council duly elected; if not, the Council shall proceed to a
fresh nomination. If no election shall take place within the space of six calendar months from the date of the vacancy,
or from the time of the creation of any new Professorship, the right of nomination and election for the purpose of filling
up such vacancy, or of appointing to such new Professorship, shall lapse to the Chancellor. No person, being at the time
a member of the Council, shall be nominated by the Council to any Professorship.</p>

<p>And, except so far as is otherwise provided by Act of Parliament, or by direction of private founders, any proposed
new rules or regulations respecting Studies, Lectures, and Examinations, save and except any Studies, Lectures, or
Examinations in relation to or connected with the School of Divinity (with which the said Council shall not have authority
to interfere); and also any proposed new rules or regulations respecting the qualifications, duties, and tenure of office of
any Professor in any Professorship now existing, or hereafter to be constituted, except the Professors and Professorships
connected with the said School of Divinity; and any proposed alterations in any existing rules or regulations respecting
such Studies, Lectures, and Examinations, qualifications, duties, and tenure of office, save as aforesaid, shall require the
approval both of the Provost and Senior Fellows, and of the Council. All such new rules or regulations, and
alterations in any rules or regulations, may be originated either by the Provost and Senior Fellows or by the Council.
No new Professorship shall be created or founded by the Provost and Senior Fellows without the consent of the Council.</p>
